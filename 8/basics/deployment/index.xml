      <description>Creating your own PrestaShop distributionA release is a build package which includes external libaries, static assets (like compiled javascript files) and modules.&#xA;A distribution is a special release that you can build with your own specific modules.&#xA;Why create a distribution?If you usually include (or exclude) modules in your PrestaShop deployments, creating your own distribution will allow you to save time when installing PrestaShop for your users. Any extra module bundled in the distribution will be installed and enabled automatically during PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s installation.</description>
