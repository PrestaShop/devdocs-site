      <description>Fundamentals of PrestaShop Development PrestaShop was conceived so that third-party modules could easily build upon its foundations, making it an extremely customizable e-commerce software.
PrestaShopâ€™s customization is based on four possibilities:
 Themes, Modules, Hooks, Overriding.  Themes are explored in full in the Themes section.
Modules, hooks and the override system are explored in this page and in the Modules section.
By default, PrestaShop is provided with more than 50 modules, enabling you to launch your online business quickly and for free.</description>
