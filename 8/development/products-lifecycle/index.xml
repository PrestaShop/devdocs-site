      <description>Products search indexIn PrestaShop, product search functionality relies on keyword-based indexing. Each search query entered in the search bar undergoes sanitization and is split into individual words. These words are then matched against the ps_search_word table. Matching product IDs are retrieved from the ps_search_index, followed by the process of weighting and sorting to deliver the most relevant product results.&#xA;flowchart TB id1[Search Query] --&gt; id2[Sanitize,\nremove unwanted words,\nsplit by words] id2 --&gt; id3[Retrieve `id_word` from `ps_search_word`] id3 --&gt; id4[Retrieve `id_product` and `weight` from `ps_search_index`] id4 --&gt; id5[Weight results to return most relevant products] Search index structure classDiagram ps_product &lt;-- ps_search_index ps_search_word &lt;-- ps_search_index ps_product : int product_id ps_product : .</description>
