      <description>Introduction to translationAt its core, translation consists in programmatically transforming a wording into its equivalent in a target language, using a translation dictionary. If the loaded dictionary is in Spanish, the output will be in Spanish.&#xA;VocabularyBefore you begin working with translations, you should get familiarized with the following concepts:&#xA;Wording (or &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo;) An abstraction of a phrase that will be translated to any given language. It&amp;rsquo;s usually written as plain English, in order to make it easier to understand.</description>

      <description>Each string created for the PrestaShop project must be associated with a translation domain, to be later translated on Crowdin by the community of translators.&#xA;When a minor or major version of PrestaShop is released, all the new strings associated with this version are added to Crowdin to be translated.&#xA;Crowdin is a localization management platform on which a community of volunteer translators works on no less than 80 translation projects.</description>

      <description>Using the Translator to translate wordings This section provides an quick reference on how to use the Translator. For more information, read Symfony&amp;rsquo;s documentation on Using the Translator. PHP filesTo translate wordings in PHP files, you first need an instance of the Translator service (explained below). Then, you can use the trans() method to translate your wording:&#xA;&amp;lt;?php echo $translator-&amp;gt;trans(&amp;#39;This product is no longer available.&amp;#39;, [], &amp;#39;Shop.Notifications.Error&amp;#39;); The trans() method takes three arguments:</description>

      <description>Native module translation To find out the basics of module translation, read Module Translation. In PrestaShop lingo, &amp;ldquo;native modules&amp;rdquo; refers to all the modules that are bundled and distributed with the Core.&#xA;In difference with 3rd party modules, native modules&amp;rsquo; translation catalogues are distributed with the Core itself. Thanks to this, Native modules are translated using the New translation system introduced in PrestaShop 1.7.</description>

      <description>Translation tips and tricks Adding new wordingsFor a wording to become translatable through the Back office interface, it has to be made available to it. PrestaShop behaves differently according to whether the wordings belong to the Core or to 3rd party modules &amp;amp; themes.&#xA;Module and theme wordingsWordings from modules and themes (except Native modules and the Classic theme) are automatically scanned from source code at runtime, so you can just use them in the code and they will magically appear in the translation interface â€” as long as you follow the coding and domain name conventions.</description>
