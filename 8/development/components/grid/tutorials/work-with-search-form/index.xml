      <description>Create your custom form factoryIn some cases the generic form factory is not enough for your need. In PrestaShop the category grid has three specific features:&#xA;it can manage a parent category which changes the grid rendering (only displays children) so it needs to dynamically add a parameter its search url doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the list so it needs to specify the form action the redirection url is dynamic so that it takes the parent category into account To manage this additional behaviour we create a decorator that uses the default form factory but adds specific behaviour.</description>
