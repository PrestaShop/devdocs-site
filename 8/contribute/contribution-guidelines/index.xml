      <title>Supported branches</title>
      <link>https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/contribute/contribution-guidelines/supported-branches/</link>

      <description>Supported branches Maintainers will only accept contributions for branches which are subject to new releases.
The development branch (develop) contains the development code for the next minor or major version, and is the natural destination for all contributions.
The patch version branch (e.g. 8.0.x) contains the code for the next patch release for a given version. This is where some bug fixes are destined, under specific conditions.
TL;DR When in doubt, target the develop branch.</description>
