# Backward Compatibility Promise

Following [Symfony](symfony-bc-break) example, PrestaShop team documented each type of Backward Compatibility Break, and which ones are allowed or not in a patch/minor/major version.

You can read it on the ADR repository [here][adr-bc-break].

This list will be used by reviewers to acknowledge whether a Pull Request contains BC Breaks or not, and if they are acceptable or not (given the PR target branch).
