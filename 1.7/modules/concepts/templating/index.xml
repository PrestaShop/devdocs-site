      <description>How to import Core JavaScript files Most of the time, you will use the global JavaScript components object. However, in some cases, you might want to import a Core component using a static path, such as admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/auto-complete-search.ts.&#xA;We don&amp;rsquo;t recommend doing this. If you absolutely need it, make sure to remove the file extension from the import path:&#xA;// Incorrect import AutoCompletSearch from &amp;#39;../../../../admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/auto-complete-search.js&amp;#39; import AutoCompletSearch from &amp;#39;../../../../admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/auto-complete-search.ts&amp;#39; // Correct import AutoCompletSearch from &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>How to override Back Office views Since PrestaShop 1.7, the back office is being progressively migrated to the Symfony framework. Even though modules are no longer allowed to override a complete controller like before (it was highly discouraged anyway), we have introduced new powerful and more efficient ways to customize the Back Office.&#xA;As part of this migration, PrestaShop is switching its templating engine from Smarty to Twig. Twig is very popular in the PHP/Symfony world, it&amp;rsquo;s well-documented and it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most efficient engines out there.</description>
