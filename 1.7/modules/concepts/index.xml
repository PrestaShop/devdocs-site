      <description>WidgetsWidget is an advanced concept introduced on PrestaShop 1.7, extending hooks feature.&#xA;Limitation of hooksIn their basic use, a display hook will be shown at a specific place in the template. If a module wants to display the same additional content on several places, whatever the merchant chose, it still has to register and implement all the possible hooks.&#xA;With widgets, module developers can display content everywhere the module is asked to do so.</description>

      <description>OverridesOverriding is a way to &amp;ldquo;override&amp;rdquo; class files and controller files. PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s ingenious class auto-loading function makes the &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; to other files fairly simple. Thanks to PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s fully object-oriented code, you can rely on object inheritance to modify and add new behaviors, using the properties and methods of the various existing classes.&#xA;Important note There are limitations and risks of using overrides. Keep them for your own shop. Overrides in PrestaShop are exclusive.</description>

      <description>ComposerComposer is a tool known in the PHP ecosystem to manage the dependencies of a project. It has been originally added in PrestaShop 1.7 to handle the inclusion of the Symfony framework and the native modules. As composer is compatible with PHP 5.3, it can be used in a module even compatible with previous major versions of PrestaShop.&#xA;From a single configuration file, a module will benefit of these features:</description>

This is a known limitation of the Commands. Removing this limitation is being explored for future PS versions.</description>

      <description>Specifics of multistore module development Usage of configuration variablesAs indicated in the Configuration section, some of the methods from the Configuration object have three optional parameters, which make it possible to target any other existing store on the current PrestaShop installation: id_shop, id_shop_group and id_lang.&#xA;While these parameters can prove useful when having to handle multiple specific and known stores from one of the presented Configuration method, they are not recommended for general usage.</description>
