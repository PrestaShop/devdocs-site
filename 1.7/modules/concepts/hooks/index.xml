      <description>List of hooks in PrestaShop 1.7 Update notesA couple of hooks were modified between 1.7.0.x and 1.7.1.x.&#xA;actionDeleteProductInCartAfter has been divided into two hooks: actionObjectProductInCartDeleteBefore. actionObjectProductInCartDeleteAfter. displayProductButtons has been renamed into displayProductAdditionalInfo.&#xA;Donâ€™t worry, we kept an alias :) Full list Search tip: Some hooks are generated dynamically, so their names are documented in a generic way.&#xA;For example, actionAdminCustomersFormModifier is documented as action&amp;lt;AdminControllerClassName&amp;gt;FormModifier, so you won&amp;rsquo;t find it if you search for the exact name.</description>

      <description>Use hooks on modern pagesYou know you can already customize your PrestaShop store thanks to many hooks: the good news is that you can still use hooks like you did in the earlier versions of PrestaShop in modern pages.&#xA;Starting from PrestaShop 1.7.3, you can access the modern Services Container into your modules and so on access powerful and customizable features available in Symfony:&#xA;Twig, the most popular templating engine; Swiftmailer, a feature-rich mailer; Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL to manage your database; Filesystem and Finder libraries to manage all filesystem operations; Monolog for every logging operations; Serializer library for whom who need to manipulate Json and Xml formats&amp;hellip; Of course, you also have access to every service used by the Core of PrestaShop.</description>
