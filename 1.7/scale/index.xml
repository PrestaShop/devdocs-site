      <description>Optimize your PrestaShop performance Before making any change on your PrestaShop instance, it is highly recommended to perform some benchmarks.
The idea behind this is to know what your baseline performance is, so that you can make sure that your changes are increasing your shop&amp;rsquo;s performance and not the other way around.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve done no benchmark beforehand, there is no way to ensure you did not decrease your performances in the end.</description>
