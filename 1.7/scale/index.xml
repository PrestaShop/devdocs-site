      <description>Optimize your PrestaShop performanceBefore making any change on your PrestaShop instance, it is highly recommended to perform some benchmarks.&#xA;The idea behind this is to know what your baseline performance is, so that you can make sure that your changes are increasing your shop&amp;rsquo;s performance and not the other way around.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;ve done no benchmark beforehand, there is no way to ensure you did not decrease your performances in the end.</description>
