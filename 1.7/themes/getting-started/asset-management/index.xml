      <description>About Webpack  Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
 The main interest of using Webpack is that it will compile all your styles - which we advise you to write using Sass  - into a single CSS file. This way, your theme will make only one HTTP request for this single file, and since your browser will cache it for later re-use, it will even download this file only once.</description>
