      <description>Patch release lifecycle Patch releases are &amp;ldquo;maintainance&amp;rdquo; releases: they provide bug fixes and security patches, but do not provide enhancements or new features. They are part of a necessary maintenance process.
Scope of maintainance When a minor version is released, such as PrestaShop 1.7.7.0, the related branch becomes the latest and maintained branch. This means that, when PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 is out:
 There will be no more PrestaShop 1.7.6 patch releases, for either bug or security issues There might be, if necessary, patch releases for PrestaShop 1.</description>

How these issues are picked or sorted is the responsibility of the Product Team, who spends a lot of time gathering feedback from the PrestaShop community to make sure the next minor version addresses the most important needs.
For example PrestaShop 1.</description>
