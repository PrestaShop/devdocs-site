      <description>How testing works in PrestaShop  PrestaShop is a complex software and uses automated testing to ensure that the new additions to the codebase do not break existing behaviors.
Automated tests are located in tests and tests-legacy folders.
What kind of tests do PrestaShop use? In the tests folder, you will find:
 Unit tests Integration tests User interface tests  Unit tests Unit tests are powered by PHPUnit. They test one and only one php class, mocking/stubbing any dependencies that class has.</description>

      <description>How to create your own unit tests or add tests to PrestaShop Unit tests are great if you want to validate the behavior of a single unit of code. By &amp;ldquo;unit of code&amp;rdquo; we usually mean a class although it could also be a script.
Creating a Unit test Everything is explained in the PHPUnit 5.7 documentation.
For unit tests, we strongly encourage you to base your test on the PHPUnit&amp;rsquo;s TestCase class only.</description>

      <description>How to execute the PrestaShop automatic test suite Executing Unit/integration test suites At least four test suites are available, testing different parts of PrestaShop:
 Legacy tests: heritage from PrestaShop 1.6: mix of unit, integration and functional tests; Legacy controllers: added to help with the Symfony migration, ensures that old Back Office controllers are still runnable; Admin tests: specific to PrestaShop 1.7, tests src/Core and src/Adapter classes; Symfony specific tests: specific to PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <title>How to create your own symfony controller tests</title>

      <description>How to create your own symfony controller tests or add tests to PrestaShop If you create your own Modern (symfony) controllers or if you plan on migrating a legacy controller, you can create tests to cover parts of HTTP layer aka symfony functional tests.
Creating a functional test To create a functional test, we encourage you to base your test class on our own implementation of WebTestCase.
For instance:
&amp;lt;?php namespace Tests\Functional\Foo; use Tests\Integration\PrestaShopBundle\Test\WebTestCase; class BarTest extends WebTestCase { public function testSomeAction() { $url = this-&amp;gt;router-&amp;gt;generate(&amp;#39;route_name&amp;#39;); $this-&amp;gt;client-&amp;gt;request(&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;, $url); $response = $this-&amp;gt;client-&amp;gt;getResponse(); self::assertTrue($response-&amp;gt;isSuccessful()); } } Find out more in Symfony&amp;rsquo;s documentation on functional testing.</description>

      <description>How to create your own Behat tests or add tests to PrestaShop  Behat tests are great if you want to validate the behavior of a component of the code and/or follow a user-oriented scenario.
By &amp;ldquo;component&amp;rdquo; we usually mean a group of classes being called together, sometimes using an external dependency (a web API or a database system like MySQL).
By &amp;ldquo;user-oriented scenario&amp;rdquo; we mean a scenario that is a series of steps, each step is an action, and at the end of the series there is an expected result</description>
