      <description>How to edit a page on GitHubEditing a page on GitHub is the most straight-forward way of contributing content to PrestaShop DevDocs.&#xA;The good: you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have anything installed. The bad: even if GitHub provides a preview of your markdown code, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see exactly how it will look like on the site (for instance, shortcodes aren&amp;rsquo;t interpreted by the GitHub preview).

      <description>Writing MarkdownThis site was created using the wonderful Hugo static site generator, but the content itself is written using Markdown.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know anything about Hugo or the Go language to write documentation. The Markdown syntax is basically plain text with some simple added syntax for styling.&#xA;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know Markdown yet, have a look at this quick Markdown guide from GitHub.&#xA;Extended features: ShortcodesHugo uses special short codes for many things.</description>
