      <description>How issues are sorted What happens to the issue you have reported PrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA) uses a transparent definition for the criteria used to qualify issues&#39; severity, and how they should be applied through labels on github issues.
Please note that severity is to be distinguished from priority. Indeed, severity is used to measure the negative impact that a bug has on a system, a feature, a component or on the project development.</description>

      <description>How Pull Requests are processed All submitted pull requests go through a thorough process which aims to provide a stable, consistent and reliable software that we all know under the name PrestaShop. Here is this process in details.
Automatic tasks when you open a Pull Request When you submit a new Pull Request to the project repository, some automatic checks are triggered.
Continuous Integration The project relies on GitHub Action to perform multiple checks against submitted Pull Requests.</description>
