      <description>How issues are sorted What happens to the issue you have reportedPrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA) uses a transparent definition for the criteria used to qualify issues&amp;rsquo; severity, and how they should be applied through labels on github issues.&#xA;Please note that severity is to be distinguished from priority. Indeed, severity is used to measure the negative impact that a bug has on a system, a feature, a component or on the project development.</description>
