      <description>How to become a Core Contributor If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, thank you! This means you&amp;rsquo;re interested in contributing to PrestaShop. You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slightly different from ours. For instance, there are few differences between PrestaShop 1.7 (the release) and the branch 1.7 of PrestaShop in the GitHub repository.

      <description>Hot to publish your contribution to GitHub Once your changes sound good and tests pass on your local computer, you can contribute to the open source project by submitting these changes as a Pull Request on GitHub.
First you need to push your branch on GitHub:
git push origin add-emoticons-support  You will need to use your GitHub credentials. Now you can create your Pull Request on GitHub. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it, you can read GitHub documentation.</description>
