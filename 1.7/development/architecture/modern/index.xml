      <description>Symfony controllers &amp;amp; routing Read the Symfony documentation on Controllers and Routing. Controllers are located in src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin folder. Starting on 1.7.3, controllers are being progressively organized in sub-folders following the Back Office menu. For instance, the TaxController is located in src/PrestaShop/Controller/Admin/Improve/International. Same applies to Improve, Sell sections etc.&#xA;This is how the directory tree of controllers should look like:&#xA;Controller/ └── Admin ├── Configure │ ├── AdvancedParameters │ └── ShopParameters ├── Improve │ ├── Design │ ├── International │ ├── Modules │ ├── Payment │ └── Shipping └── Sell ├── Catalog ├── Customers ├── CustomerService ├── Orders └── Stats Symfony Controllers should be thin by default and have only one responsibility: getting the HTTP Request from the client and returning an HTTP Response.</description>
