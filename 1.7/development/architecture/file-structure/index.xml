      <description>Understanding the &amp;ldquo;src&amp;rdquo; folder The main idea when doing the 1.7 release was to use Symfony as a replacement for our own PrestaShop framework.
In the /src folder you&amp;rsquo;ll find 3 main folders with different purposes:
 Core: contains business logic classes Adapter: business logic classes that still depend on legacy framework (for instance: Context, Dispatcher or constants); PrestaShopBundle: classes that acts as a glue between PrestaShop classes and Symfony  Core Core classes belong to the PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core namespace.</description>
