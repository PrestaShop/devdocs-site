      <description>Basic checks Syntax check First of all, making sure your file is understood by PHP is a trivial but critical check. PHP provides a linter to verify a file can be run:
$ php -l &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; Syntax check only (lint) The linter can be run on a whole project if a list of files to check is created. On a Linux bash, this command looks for all the PHP files (except in folders vendor and tests) then runs the linter on each of them:</description>

      <description>Create your custom form factory In some cases the generic form factory is not enough for your need. In PrestaShop the category grid has three specific features:
 it can manage a parent category which changes the grid rendering (only displays children) so it needs to dynamically add a parameter its search url doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the list so it needs to specify the form action the redirection url is dynamic so that it takes the parent category into account  To manage this additional behaviour we create a decorator that uses the default form factory but adds specific behaviour.</description>

      <description>How to handle multi lang Doctrine entity  Multi lang fields in PrestaShop A common use case in a CMS (Content Management System) is to handle translatable fields (or multi lang fields). In the legacy model of PrestaShop this is managed via an automatic mechanism and some configuration in the ObjectModel, thus all translatable fields are stored in a dedicated table. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have a quote table then its translatable fields will be stored in a quote_lang each row being an association between a quote row and a lang row (containing the languages installed on a PrestaShop shop).</description>

      <description>Introduction Technical principles behind a module A PrestaShop module consists of a main PHP file with as many other PHP files as needed, as well as the necessary template (.tpl) files and assets (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) to display the module&amp;rsquo;s interface, whether to the customer (on the front office) or to the merchant (on the back office).
Any PrestaShop module, once installed on an online shop, can interact with one or more &amp;ldquo;hooks&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>How testing works in PrestaShop  PrestaShop is a complex software and uses automated testing to ensure that the new additions to the codebase do not break existing behaviors.
Automated tests are located in tests and tests-legacy folders.
What kind of tests do PrestaShop use? In the tests folder, you will find:
 Unit tests Integration tests User interface tests  Unit tests Unit tests are powered by PHPUnit. They test one and only one php class, mocking/stubbing any dependencies that class has.</description>

      <description>Module base creation Composer autoloading Let&amp;rsquo;s create module folder demovieworderhooks inside modules directory (located in the root of PrestaShop project). Then create composer.json in the root of the module to autoload classes with the namespaces (PrestaShop\Module\DemoViewOrderHooks\) we define from the src folder (https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading). Using composer PSR-4 autoload helps us autoload classes without the need to use require_once __DIR__.&#39;/vendor/autoload.php&#39;; .
Even though using autoload block in composer.json helps us to autoload classes from the specified folder src with the namespace PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\ we might have some autoloading issues if we use our classes in our module main file demovieworderhooks.</description>

      <description>New module translation system  The new module translation system is based on the new system introduced in PrestaShop 1.7 for the Core and Native modules. It aims to harmonize translation systems throughout PrestaShop while providing backwards compatibility.
This feature is only available for PrestaShop 1.7.6 and later. If you need to support older versions, see the Classic translation system. Vocabulary  Wording – A string that you may want to translate.</description>

      <description>Patch release lifecycle Patch releases are &amp;ldquo;maintainance&amp;rdquo; releases: they provide bug fixes and security patches, but do not provide enhancements or new features. They are part of a necessary maintenance process.
Scope of maintainance When a minor version is released, such as PrestaShop 1.7.7.0, the related branch becomes the latest and maintained branch. This means that, when PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 is out:
 There will be no more PrestaShop 1.7.6 patch releases, for either bug or security issues There might be, if necessary, patch releases for PrestaShop 1.</description>

Configuring your IDE hints or using automated tools can help you make sure you follow the project&amp;rsquo;s standards properly. Let&amp;rsquo;s create a simple first module; this will enable us to better describe its structure. We will name it &amp;ldquo;My module&amp;rdquo;.
First, create the module&amp;rsquo;s folder, in PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s /modules folder. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it mymodule.</description>

 Writing documentation is hard.
We try to find excuses and rationalize and lie to ourselves so we can feel better about the fact that we should be doing it, but it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too much work&amp;rdquo;.
Here are two good reasons to try and convince you to start writing documentation, and help you while you help others, too:</description>

      <description>Classic module translation system The classic translation system is a heritage from previous versions of PrestaShop and provides retrocompatibility with PrestaShop 1.6.
Do you need this?
 If you plan on supporting only versions 1.7.6 and up, consider using the New translation system. Modern (symfony-based) modules and native modules only support the new system.   How it works This system works in two steps.
1. Translation functions are used to display your module&amp;rsquo;s wordings in another language PrestaShop provides functions that allow PHP files and Smarty templates to display translated wordings.</description>

      <description>How to become a Core Contributor If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, thank you! This means you&amp;rsquo;re interested in contributing to PrestaShop. You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slightly different from ours. For instance, there are few differences between PrestaShop 1.7 (the release) and the branch 1.7 of PrestaShop in the GitHub repository. This is because we create a release usable by everyone from our sources.</description>

      <description>How to become a Core Contributor If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, thank you! This means you&amp;rsquo;re interested in contributing to PrestaShop. You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slightly different from ours. For instance, there are few differences between PrestaShop 1.7 (the release) and the branch 1.7 of PrestaShop in the GitHub repository. This is because we create a release usable by everyone from our sources.</description>

      <title>FAQ about Vue.js</title>

      <description>How to send data from PHP to Vue.js? Use the method Media::addJsDef([]) to make your data available in the window context. If other modules can be present on the same, prefix your names with the module name to avoid name collision.
This is a convenient way to send the links Vue.js could call, generated by the router.
Example:
Media::addJsDef([ &amp;#39;myVueJsModuleRouteToSomeAction&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;context-&amp;gt;link-&amp;gt;getAdminLink( &amp;#39;AdminAjaxMyVueJsModule&amp;#39;, true, [], [ &amp;#39;action&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;RouteToSomeAction&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ajax&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; 1, ] ), ]); How to send data from Symfony controller to Vue.</description>

      <description>Module file structure A module is made of a lot of files, all stored in a folder that bears the same name as the module, that folder being in turn stored in the /modules folder at the root of the main PrestaShop folder: /modules/&amp;lt;modulename&amp;gt;/.
Your module can be called anything, as long as it only contains lowercase letters and numbers (/[a-z0-9]/). Although accepted, we strongly discourage using underscores (_) because they don&amp;rsquo;t work with translation domains.</description>

      <description>How to contribute and create UI tests Architecture Page Object Model (also called Page Object Pattern) is a way to organize your code in a test framework. It encourages you to separate your test logic from your page manipulation logic.
Our team uses POM as an architecture to organize the code: on one side we have our page logic, and on the other side we have our test logic.
The goal is to write your test code once, and only change the page logic when someone updates the application.</description>

      <description>List of hooks in PrestaShop 1.7 Update notes A couple of hooks were modified between 1.7.0.x and 1.7.1.x.
 actionDeleteProductInCartAfter has been divided into two hooks:  actionObjectProductInCartDeleteBefore. actionObjectProductInCartDeleteAfter.   displayProductButtons has been renamed into displayProductAdditionalInfo.
Don’t worry, we kept an alias :)  Full list Search tip: Some hooks are generated dynamically, so their names are documented in a generic way.
For example, actionAdminCustomersFormModifier is documented as action&amp;lt;AdminControllerClassName&amp;gt;FormModifier, so you won&amp;rsquo;t find it if you search for the exact name.</description>

How these issues are picked or sorted is the responsibility of the Product Team, who spends a lot of time gathering feedback from the PrestaShop community to make sure the next minor version addresses the most important needs.

How these issues are picked or sorted is the responsibility of the Product Team, who spends a lot of time gathering feedback from the PrestaShop community to make sure the next minor version addresses the most important needs.
For example PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <description>Signature card displayAdminOrderSide hook We use this hook to display scanned customer signature.
Lets create custom repository OrderSignatureRepository class inside demovieworderhooks/src/Repository folder. Symfony Repository classes (https://symfony.com/doc/3.3/doctrine/repository.html) help to interact with the database by providing frequently used functions like findOneBy to get the data (for example filtered data by a certain criteria - orderId field from OrderSignature entity).

      <description>Technical Validation: key steps Have you ever wondered how the PrestaShop Addons Team proceeds with the validation ?
We are going to show you how to spare time so that you can pretty much &amp;ldquo;validate&amp;rdquo; your own module before submitting it to the Addons Marketplace. First you might want to read the Technical Tools and the Good Practices.
1. The Basics As you probably know, there are 3 types of submissions : New, Minor update, Major update.</description>

      <description>How to benchmark your PrestaShop Shop (Back-office) Benchmark methodology In order to benchmark the performances of the backoffice of your shop, you will use the Gatling testing tool.
 Note: Backoffice benchmark is only possible starting with PrestaShop 1.7.4.0!
  If you want still want to run the test for version &amp;lt; 1.7.4.0, take a look at this PR: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/8876
 What is Gatling? Gatling is a stress tool. Development is currently focusing on HTTP support.</description>

You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slightly different from ours. For instance, there are few differences between PrestaShop 1.7 (the release) and the branch 1.7 of PrestaShop in the GitHub repository. This is because we create a release usable by everyone from our sources.</description>

Starting from PrestaShop 1.7.3, you can access the modern Services Container into your modules and so on access powerful and customizable features available in Symfony:
 Twig, the most popular templating engine; Swiftmailer, a feature-rich mailer; Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL to manage your database; Filesystem and Finder libraries to manage all filesystem operations; Monolog for every logging operations; Serializer library for whom who need to manipulate Json and Xml formats&amp;hellip;  Of course, you also have access to every service used by the Core of PrestaShop.</description>

      <description>Widgets Widget is an advanced concept introduced on PrestaShop 1.7, extending hooks feature.
Limitation of hooks In their basic use, a display hook will be shown at a specific place in the template. If a module wants to display the same additional content on several places, whatever the merchant chose, it still has to register and implement all the possible hooks.
With widgets, module developers can display content everywhere the module is asked to do so.</description>

      <description>Adding a configuration page Modules usually provide a dedicated configuration page, accessible through a &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; button in the Module Manager list, that allows the shop&amp;rsquo;s administrator to set up any options provided by the module.
In difference with other controllers, the content of configuration page is handled directly in the module&amp;rsquo;s main class by the getContent() public method. PrestaShop will check if this method exists and will only display the &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; button if this method is declared.</description>

      <description>Alter configuration forms on modern pages  One of the most common tasks for the PrestaShop developers is to alter the data and make it manageable for customers. In PrestaShop 1.6, a specific Form framework was created to help developers. In PrestaShop 1.7, the system has changed as we now rely on the Symfony Form component.
This system only works with pages from the &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; section of your back office.</description>

      <description>Create a resource Creation workflow The creation workflow is a bit more complex than reading some data from the API, mainly because we rarely manage data via XML format. In most use cases the user is presented with a human understandable component, like a form, and the data entered is then processed. Besides we need to make sure that the XML sent to the webservice is understandable and complete.
As we explained in a previous tutorial the webservice provides two resource schemas.</description>

      <description>How to extend a grid with Javascript extensions Introduction Javascript grid extensions supplement grid behavior and enhance user experience. For example, most grids contains SortingExtension which provides sorting by columns functionality, BulkActionCheckboxExtension which enables interactive selection of bulk actions and so on. But the fact is that most of grids will not necessarily need all features, so by using extensions we encourage to easily add or remove grid feature while loading only necessary javascript code.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/templating/import-js/</guid>
      <description>How to import Core JavaScript files  Most of the time, you will use the global JavaScript components object. However, in some cases, you might want to import a Core component using a static path, such as admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/auto-complete-search.ts.
We don&amp;rsquo;t recommend doing this. If you absolutely need it, make sure to remove the file extension from the import path:
// Incorrect import AutoCompletSearch from &amp;#39;../../../../admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/auto-complete-search.js&amp;#39; import AutoCompletSearch from &amp;#39;../../../../admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/auto-complete-search.ts&amp;#39; // Correct import AutoCompletSearch from &amp;#39;.</description>

      <description>How to override Back Office views  Since PrestaShop 1.7, the back office is being progressively migrated to the Symfony framework. Even though modules are no longer allowed to override a complete controller like before (it was highly discouraged anyway), we have introduced new powerful and more efficient ways to customize the Back Office.
As part of this migration, PrestaShop is switching its templating engine from Smarty to Twig. Twig is very popular in the PHP/Symfony world, it&amp;rsquo;s well-documented and it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most efficient engines out there.</description>

      <description>Manage Configuration You can manage your shop configuration thanks to the API, in this example we will set the PS_MULTISHOP_FEATURE_ACTIVE to true (which enables multishop mode).
API call First check if the configuration already exists by using filters and display parameters /api/configurations/?display=[id,name,value]&amp;amp;filter[name]=[PS_MULTISHOP_FEATURE_ACTIVE]
Create configuration If the configuration doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet, you will receive an empty list:

      <description>Displaying content on the front office As it is, the module does not do much. In order to display something on the front office, we have to add support for a few hooks. This is done by implementing the hooks&#39; methods, and that was actually done in the install() method we wrote earlier, using the registerHook() method:
&amp;lt;?php public function install() { if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) { Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); } return parent::install() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;registerHook(&amp;#39;leftColumn&amp;#39;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;registerHook(&amp;#39;actionFrontControllerSetMedia&amp;#39;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Configuration::updateValue(&amp;#39;MYMODULE_NAME&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;my friend&amp;#39;); } As you can see, we make it so that the module is hooked to the &amp;ldquo;leftColumn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;actionFrontControllerSetMedia&amp;rdquo; hooks.</description>

      <description>Enabling the Auto-Update Since PrestaShop 1.5, it is possible to have your module auto-update: once a new version is available, PrestaShop suggests an &amp;ldquo;Update&amp;rdquo; button to the user. Clicking this button will trigger a series of methods, each leading closer to the latest version of your module.
In order to bring auto-update support to your module, you need three main things:
 Clearly indicate the module&amp;rsquo;s version number in its constructor method: $this-&amp;gt;version = &#39;1.</description>

PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s ingenious class auto-loading function makes the &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; to other files fairly simple. Thanks to PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s fully object-oriented code, you can rely on object inheritance to modify and add new behaviors, using the properties and methods of the various existing classes.
Important note There are limitations and risks of using overrides. Keep them for your own shop. Overrides in PrestaShop are exclusive.</description>

      <description>Composer Composer is a tool known in the PHP ecosystem to manage the dependencies of a project. It has been originally added in PrestaShop 1.7 to handle the inclusion of the Symfony framework and the native modules. As composer is compatible with PHP 5.3, it can be used in a module even compatible with previous major versions of PrestaShop.
From a single configuration file, a module will benefit of these features:</description>

      <description>Commands  Since version 1.7 of PrestaShop, everyone have access to the PrestaShop console using the following instruction in a terminal:
./bin/console
Since v1.7.5, you can add and provide your own commands into the PrestaShop console using modules.
If you load and use PrestaShop Core legacy classes such as an ObjectModel within a Command context, you might run into issues. This is a known limitation of the Commands. Removing this limitation is being explored for future PS versions.</description>

      <description>CQRS - Commands and Queries What is CQRS? CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. In brief, the CQRS pattern suggests to separate &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; models, which it refers to as Commands and Queries. In a web application like a CMS, we perform either &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; operations which return information to the user or &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; operations which modify the data managed by the application.
Why using CQRS in PrestaShop? During Back Office migration to Symfony, PrestaShop needs a way to access and alter data on the new Symfony pages without multiplying the sources of truth, and without accessing ObjectModel (e.</description>

      <description>Domain services As mentioned in CQRS principles, a Command is a representation of a single domain use case. To prevent Command Handlers from duplicating code and depending on each other, it is usually best to avoid implementing the actual logic in the Command Handler itself, and delegate it to Domain Services instead. These services are responsible for logic such as:
 Persisting the entities (a.k.a ObjectModel in current prestashop architecture) data into database Validating the entities Performing various modifications of related data structures etc.</description>

      <description>Getting Started About CRUD &amp;amp; REST The PrestaShop web service uses the REST architecture in order to be available on as many platforms as possible, since the HTTP protocol and XML files are understood by most platforms, if not all.
CRUD is an acronym that stands for &amp;ldquo;Create, Read, Update, and Delete&amp;rdquo;. These are the four basic operations for managing data in an application.
REST defines roughly a style of software architecture, which promotes the use of HTTP methods when building web application, instead of custom methods or protocols such as SOAP or WSDL.</description>

      <description>How to backup PrestaShop Important
It is strongly recommended not to leave your backups at the root of your store or in another place where could be exposed on publicly.
 Before starting anything, you must think first about safety. Any modification made on a shop could break it, so you must make sure all your data has been backed up before going further. This basically implies saving two things: your files and your database.</description>

      <description>Introduction to translation At its core, translation consists in programmatically transforming a wording into its equivalent in a target language, using a translation dictionary. If the loaded dictionary is in Spanish, the output will be in Spanish.
Vocabulary Before you begin working with translations, you should get familiarized with the following concepts:
 Wording (or &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo;) An abstraction of a phrase that will be translated to any given language. It&amp;rsquo;s usually written as plain English, in order to make it easier to understand.</description>

      <description>Preliminary tasks Before you can start your build, you must make sure that the project is ready to be built.
1. Create the new version in Addons Marketplace and update native module compatibility This step requires special rights.
Ask a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with administrative rights on the Addons Marketplace to perform this step.
 This only needs to be done once per release.
(i.e. if done for a beta, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be performed again for the final release).</description>

The main advantage is that it makes it possible for you to entirely bypass the process of uploading your files on your online server in order to test your changes. Another advantage is that a local test environment enables you to test code without the risk of breaking your production store.</description>

All template files must be stored in the theme&amp;rsquo;s templates/ subfolder. For instance, the default theme has its template files in the following folder: /themes/classic/templates.
Directory structure Templates are then split between various subfolders.
 /_partials/ Code shared accross the whole site like header, footer or notifications. /catalog/ Product page, product/brand/supplier listing, search result and such. /checkout/ Cart, delivery options, payement options, order confirmations and such.</description>

      <description>Templating with Twig This is mostly the easy part. Legacy pages use Smarty while modern pages use Twig. These templating engines are actually similar in many ways.
For instance, this is a legacy template:
&amp;lt;span class=&amp;#34;employee_avatar_small&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;#34;img&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;{$employee_image}&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; {$employee_name}  All of the legacy templates are located in the admin-dev/themes/default/template/controller folder &amp;hellip; and here is a possible migration of it to Twig:
&amp;lt;span class=&amp;#34;employee_avatar_small&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;#34;img&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;{{ employee.</description>

      <description>Templating with Twig This is mostly the easy part. Legacy pages use Smarty while modern pages use Twig. These templating engines are actually similar in many ways.
For instance, this is a legacy template:
&amp;lt;span class=&amp;#34;employee_avatar_small&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;#34;img&amp;#34; alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;{$employee_image}&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; {$employee_name}  All of the legacy templates are located in the admin-dev/themes/default/template/controller folder &amp;hellip; and here is a possible migration of it to Twig:

      <description>Testing What makes a theme valid When you&amp;rsquo;re trying to select a theme in the backoffice, PrestaShop will test if your theme is valid. It won&amp;rsquo;t install if the theme isn&amp;rsquo;t valid.
A theme is valid if it contains some files and some configuration keys.
Required files Here is the complete list of required files:
 preview.png config/theme.yml assets/js/theme.js assets/css/theme.css templates/_partials/form-field.tpl templates/catalog/product.tpl templates/catalog/listing/product-list.tpl templates/checkout/cart.tpl templates/checkout/checkout.tpl templates/cms/category.tpl templates/cms/page.tpl templates/customer/address.tpl templates/customer/addresses.tpl templates/customer/guest-tracking.tpl templates/customer/guest-login.</description>

A behaviour (behat) tests are a part of integration tests. They allow testing how multiple components are working together. In PrestaShop, behats are used to test the Application and Domain layer integration - basically all the CQRS commands and queries.
Database During behat tests the actual database queries are executed, therefore before testing you need to run a command composer create-test-db to create a test database.</description>

      <description>CRUD Forms Introduction In computer programming, CRUD is an acronym for the four basic functions of persistent storage: create, read, update, and delete.
PrestaShop handles several logic objects, like Cart, Product, Order, Customer&amp;hellip; among many others. When such objects are stored using a unique identifier, we refer to them as identifiable objects.
In the Back Office, most identifiable objects are managed using forms and page listings that follow the CRUD pattern.</description>

      <description>Data Transfer Objects PrestaShop is using Data Transfer Objects (or DTOs) in its codebase, in this section you learn how you can benefit from using DTOs as well.
What is Data Transfer Object? Data Transfer Object is object (e.g. UserData) that contains data in a structured format. This means that DTO usually comes with getter methods or public properties for accessing it&amp;rsquo;s data. The main benefit of using DTOs is that you know what data it has.</description>

      <description>How to create your own symfony controller tests or add tests to PrestaShop If you create your own Modern (symfony) controllers or if you plan on migrating a legacy controller, you can create tests to cover parts of HTTP layer aka symfony functional tests.
Creating a functional test To create a functional test, we encourage you to base your test class on our own implementation of WebTestCase.
For instance:
&amp;lt;?php namespace Tests\Functional\Foo; use Tests\Integration\PrestaShopBundle\Test\WebTestCase; class BarTest extends WebTestCase { public function testSomeAction() { $url = this-&amp;gt;router-&amp;gt;generate(&amp;#39;route_name&amp;#39;); $this-&amp;gt;client-&amp;gt;request(&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;, $url); $response = $this-&amp;gt;client-&amp;gt;getResponse(); self::assertTrue($response-&amp;gt;isSuccessful()); } } Find out more in Symfony&amp;rsquo;s documentation on functional testing.</description>

      <description>Symfony bridge for hooks In Back-Office, migrated pages are powered by Symfony. The powerful Symfony Event Dispatcher has been chosen to replace, in the long term, hooks. However, in order to preserve backward compatibility, both systems coexist in 1.7.
It is important that modules which subscribe to a hook are correctly notified no matter where the hook is dispatched from, be it in legacy code or modern code.
In legacy code, hooks are dispatched using Hook::exec().</description>

      <description>Tooling prerequisites for theme designers The way 1.7 themes are created is significantly different from the way they were with PrestaShop 1.6. By taking the freedom to rewrite the way themes work according to the latest best-practices, we chose to also work with modern tools. These tools are widely accepted as best-of-breed in the current web development; hence, learning to use them will not only make you more productive in PrestaShop development, but more importantly in web development in general.</description>

      <description>Translation Domains Sometimes wordings may seem vague when seen out of context. For example, &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo;. Just like that, we can imagine what is it used for, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really have much information about it. What are we deleting? From a translator standpoint, this is very hard, because not only do we not know where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be used, but it could be used in several places, with different meanings.</description>

      <description>Value Objects PrestaShop is using Value Objects in its codebase. To help you understand better what they are, this article aims to explain what Value object is and how to use it.
What is Value Object? Value Objects (VO for short) are small, simple, immutable objects, like Money or a date range, whose equality is not based on their identity. This means that any two given instances of a same VO are considered equal when they contain the same values.</description>

      <description>Configuring PrestaShop By default, PrestaShop is configured to provide a secure and stable environment to both the shop administrator and the customers.
As a developer, there are several changes that you could and should bring to the default installation in order to help you code better, spot bugs faster, and generally make a great PrestaShop product.
Disabling the cache and forcing Smarty compilation When your development has an impact on the front office, whether you are building a theme or simply a module which displays information to the customer, you should force the template file compilation and disable the cache, so as to always see the result of your changes directly.</description>

      <description>Domain exceptions With introduction of domain driven design in PrestaShop, a new way of error handling in the code is seeing the daylight. The code in PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Domain namespace started to utilize domain exceptions.
What is a domain exception A domain exception is an exception, that is thrown in application&amp;rsquo;s domain level, which is specific to that particular domain. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how domain exceptions look like in the code. For this example, let&amp;rsquo;s look at Category domain:</description>

Of course one possibility is to add a new theme folder in mails/themes/ but it&amp;rsquo;s not the most convenient if you want to install/uninstall it easily and quickly, so let&amp;rsquo;s integrate the theme in a module.
Just like we did to add a layout from a module we are going to use the actionListMailThemes hook, except this time we are going to add a whole email theme.</description>

      <description>Notifications Throughout the whole front office, the customer can receive notification messages from PrestaShop, to inform about successes or errors for instance. Your theme can also send notifications when certain events occur.
The notification messages are not hard-coded in the template files, but are sent from the controller, so that you have consistency in case you update/change your theme. Thus, this way there is a better chance that all notification messages are already translated into your language!</description>

      <description>Reviewing Pull Requests The code review process is generally regarded as a good practice and is adopted by hundreds of software projects around the world.
It provides lot of benefits:
 it helps spotting errors in the code, because we all make mistakes and it can be hard to find one&amp;rsquo;s own mistakes. it helps improving code quality not only by ensuring it&amp;rsquo;s readable and understandable, but also by pinpointing design, performance or security issues that may have been unintentionally introduced by the author.</description>

      <description>Supported branches Maintainers should only accept contributions for branches which are subject to new releases.
Once a minor &amp;ldquo;dot-zero&amp;rdquo; version has been released, no new patch releases will be made for previous versions. This means that only the latest minor version patch branch is supported – with the exception of rare cases, like a security bug being found just before or after a minor release is published.
For example, the 1.</description>

      <description>Understanding the &amp;ldquo;src&amp;rdquo; folder The main idea when doing the 1.7 release was to use Symfony as a replacement for our own PrestaShop framework.
In the /src folder you&amp;rsquo;ll find 3 main folders with different purposes:
 Core: contains business logic classes Adapter: business logic classes that still depend on legacy framework (for instance: Context, Dispatcher or constants); PrestaShopBundle: classes that acts as a glue between PrestaShop classes and Symfony  Core Core classes belong to the PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core namespace.</description>

      <description>Controller and Routing Before creating a new symfony controller please read and follow principles described in Symfony controllers &amp;amp; routing. Controllers are responsible for performing &amp;ldquo;Actions&amp;rdquo;. Actions are methods of Controllers which mapped to a route, and that return a Response. Migration tips  If you consider that a legacy Controller needs to be split into multiple controllers (for example: different URLs), it&amp;rsquo;s the right time to do it. Controllers are not available for override and can be regarded as internal classes, therefore we don&amp;rsquo;t consider changing Controller&amp;rsquo;s namespace as a backward-compatibility break.</description>

      <description>Final steps 1. Update API stream for 1-click upgrade This should only be done for stable releases.
(i.e. if not for betas and RCs).
 This step requires special rights.
Ask a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with administrative rights on the PrestaShop API repository to perform this step.
 Once this step is done, update the Release Tracker GitHub issue by ticking the &amp;ldquo;Available for upgrade&amp;rdquo; box.
2. Create Docker images for the new version  Checkout the project and create a new branch Modify the file versions.</description>

      <description>How to migrate hooks Hooks are the most important feature for the PrestaShop developers because they allow them to improve PrestaShop by adding code or content in multiple points of the application. For Symfony developers, you can see that as Events on steroids. To keep some degree of compatibility with 1.6 or 1.7 (pre-Symfony migration) modules, we need to ensure that hooks are still available, invoked and/or rendered at the right place.</description>

      <description>How to add layout variables from a module You can add your own layout variables which may be used in you custom template. To demonstrate this feature we assume you already have added you custom layout to a theme (see How to add a layout in a theme from a module). Here is an example of a layout using a customMessage variable.

      <description>Listing pages Your catalog is mostly 2 things: a list of products and a detailed product page.
This section covers the listing pages, which includes: category, search result, products per brand, best seller list, new product list and so on.
In order to reduce code duplication, the only necessary template is the file catalog/listing/product-list.tpl.
Extending product-list template We already covered how PrestaShop chooses the right template to use so we know that the category template extends the product-list template.</description>

      <description>How to compile assets Some components in PrestaShop, like Javascript or SCSS files, need to be compiled to be usable.
Requirements We use Webpack to compile assets. You only need NodeJS from 8.x to 12.x (get it here), NPM will take care of it all.
Assets that need to be compiled  Back Office  Default theme  SASS files
Located in admin-dev/themes/default/sass   New theme  SCSS files</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the PrestaShop UIKit? The UIKit is a project extending Bootstrap 4 in order to provide some components with PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s colors. You can see every component on this page.
How do we use the UIKit? We use it by adding it into our npm dependency, and then you&amp;rsquo;ve multiple possibilities to use it.
 You can import dist files, it means that you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to use our variables outside of the UIKit.</description>

      <description>Validation The purpose of validation is to protect the application from failures, state inconsistency, security related issues etc. PrestaShop has few different levels of validation:
 Forms (the CRUD or Settings) - are using Symfony validation constraints to prevent the user from providing invalid information while also enriching the user experience. For example if a form input expects Yes or No, but user submitted value XYZ we want to reject the data and inform the user what was wrong.</description>

      <description>Context component The Context is a component first introduced with version 1.5 of PrestaShop. Its two goals are:
 preventing developers from using global variables. enabling them to change the context of some methods.  The Context is a registry for PHP variables that were previously accessed as globals. It aims to standardize the way these variables are accessed, and to make the code more robust by getting rid of global vars.</description>

      <description>CLI Context helper The legacy framework of PrestaShop was not built to be run from a Command Line.
The consequence is that many of its functions require specific data to be properly initialized, and these parts are being initialized when an HTTP request is handled by the framework.
In order to use legacy classes and components in Console, you need to initialize these parts. To make it easy, a LegacyContextLoader helper class was introduced in version 1.</description>

      <description>Generate a Symfony route from a module Manual generation If the module uses a symfony controller then the best way of route generation is described in symfony docs.

      <description>Global JavaScript components  It&amp;rsquo;s a new system available since the 1.7.8 version mainly created for module developers, which allow you to use components we already use in the core without importing it. Here is the ADR where we decided what we should do to avoid this problem.
You are now able to use components we expose to the window.prestashop.component object without importing anything.
This object contains two attributes:
 component which contain some components you can instantiate; instance which contains every instances of initiated components.</description>

      <description>Hook tips Let&amp;rsquo;s say we need to add some javascript to the &amp;lsquo;Order create&amp;rsquo; BO page. So we use hookActionAdminControllerSetMedia. This hook is called on every BO page, so we need to filter the executions.
if (&amp;#39;AdminOrders&amp;#39; === Tools::getValue(&amp;#39;controller&amp;#39;)) { // now we know we are only applying changes to admin order pages,  // but we aren&amp;#39;t yet sure if it&amp;#39;s a order create or order view page } In case we are using Prestashop version lower than 1.</description>

      <description>Legacy Controllers Legacy controllers are based on PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s custom framework and go a long way back. All front controllers and all Admin controllers that haven&amp;rsquo;t been migrated to Symfony yet are based on this.
Execution flow Legacy controllers work best when a Controller performs a single action, for example, render a page. The process has been divided in several methods, which simplifies customization via method override.

      <description>Migrating from PrestaShop 1.6 PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a totally reworked theme system from version 1.6, with the goal of making PrestaShop upgrades easier, and making it easier and faster to create a brand new theme.
The huge change to the theme system means that there is no easy way to migrate your PrestaShop 1.6 theme to PrestaShop 1.7.
When using the automatic upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to 1.7, your theme will be switched to the new default theme, called &amp;ldquo;Classic&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Specifics of multistore module development Usage of configuration variables As indicated in the Configuration section, some of the methods from the Configuration object have three optional parameters, which make it possible to target any other existing store on the current PrestaShop installation: id_shop, id_shop_group and id_lang.
While these parameters can prove useful when having to handle multiple specific and known stores from one of the presented Configuration method, they are not recommended for general usage.</description>

      <description>The ObjectModel class When needing to dive deep, you have to use the ObjectModel class. This is the main object of PrestaShop’s object model. It can be overridden… with precaution.
It is an Active Record kind of class (see: Active record pattern). The table attributes or view attributes of PrestaShop’s database are encapsulated in this class. Therefore, the class is tied to a database record. After the object has been instantiated, a new record is added to the database.</description>

      <description>Open Source Project FAQ This section covers frequently asked questions about the Open Source Project.
Why is issue X still not fixed after so long? Not having an issue fixed immediately (or in a fixed timeframe) does not mean that it won&amp;rsquo;t be fixed, or that maintainers don&amp;rsquo;t care. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the issue is NOT important either. It just means that other issues have been considered, for whatever reason, more important, so they were (or are being) tackled first.</description>

      <description>Enabling compression As you may be aware of, most of the file transiting from the webserver (with the notable exception of pictures) are text based.
And text files are the most efficient to compress. Though disabled by default, enabling compression is a really quick way to reduce transit and speed up your website up to 80%!
First, make sure the deflate module is activated in your httpd configuration file:
LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.</description>

      <description>Optimize your PrestaShop performance Before making any change on your PrestaShop instance, it is highly recommended to perform some benchmarks.
The idea behind this is to know what your baseline performance is, so that you can make sure that your changes are increasing your shop&amp;rsquo;s performance and not the other way around.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve done no benchmark beforehand, there is no way to ensure you did not decrease your performances in the end.</description>

      <description>Override or decorate a Core controller  If you want to extend the behavior of a Back Office page in PrestaShop, you have multiple options.
Most of standard extension needs can be fulfilled using one hook.
If there is no hook available for your need, and you only need to modify the visual appearance of the page, you might want to override a template.
But sometimes you want to modify the page in a deeper way.</description>

      <description>Overriding modules When you write a theme, you often need to override the templates and assets coming from a module so that they match your theme&amp;rsquo;s specific markup needs. Themes can override modules&#39; assets (CSS and JavaScript only) by placing the corresponding file at a specific location.
With PrestaShop 1.7, all module overriding code goes to the modules directory (in your module&amp;rsquo;s own directory). Every PS 1.7 module developer should be aware of this change (introduced with PR 5020: https://github.</description>

      <description>Overriding selectors When you write a theme, you often need to change the markup, but if you do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter some problems because core&amp;rsquo;s and classic&amp;rsquo;s javascript use some class in order to work.
Two selectors maps are available since 1.7.8 one on the core side (/themes/_core/js/selectors.js) and another one inside the classic theme (/themes/classic/_dev/js/selectors.js).
That means that almost every selectors we use inside every JS files are inside these two files.</description>

      <description>Parent/child theme PrestaShop 1.7 relies a lot on template inheritance in order to create the most consistent theme possible while heavily reducing the amount of duplicated code.
We took it even further introducing the Parent Child theme feature. The point to is to avoid modifying the main theme so you can update it!
This feature is only useful if you want to slightly modify a theme (to add a block for example).</description>

A: By default, when a product is displayed in a list its cover image is used, it is configurable in the BackOffice and is set in product properties via the cover_image_id key. If you want to change this default behaviour you can use the actionGetProductPropertiesAfter in your module and change this key.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/internationalization/rtl/</guid>
      <description>Right-to-Left languages PrestaShop supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages natively, both in the Back Office and the Front Office. It can automatically transform themes to make them compatible with RTL languages.
Any Front Office theme can be transformed automatically by PrestaShop. Read &amp;ldquo;RTL support&amp;rdquo; in the Themes section to learn more about this system.
Back Office support The Back Office uses the same &amp;ldquo;theme-flipping&amp;rdquo; system as the Front Office feature. While for Front Office themes the transformation procedure must be triggered manually, in the BO this is performed automatically whenever an RTL language is activated on the shop, either by installing an RTL language or by setting up a language as RTL via edit in the BO.</description>

      <description>Router and Dispatcher The legacy Dispatcher and the Symfony Router are in charge of parsing incoming HTTP requests and finding the right Controller to return HTTP response.
Front office routing The Front office controllers lie in the controllers/front directory.
The Dispatcher matches a given HTTP request with a Front Office controller.
When you visit / on your shop, you are being returned the Homepage unless you have your shop installed in a subdirectory, then /your_subdirectory is your Homepage.</description>

      <description>RTL support PrestaShop supports RTL (Right-to-left) themes natively.
RTL stylesheets There are two ways of customizing your theme for RTL: either by adding an override file that is only loaded for RTL languages, or by using completely different version of the theme&amp;rsquo;s stylesheets.
CSS override file PrestaShop will try to load a css file named rtl.css after your theme&amp;rsquo;s ones when displayed in an RTL language. You can use this file to place any style override you need for RTL.</description>

      <description>Stock FAQ  StockAvailable StockMovement  Q: Where exactly can I find the stock of a specified product?
A: All the stock information for every Product (and Combination) is stored in the StockAvailable entity/table. You will find duplicate values in Product and Combination object via their quantity fields, but they are deprecated fields that are only kept for backward compatibility and will be removed in future versions. The only true source of information for stock data is StockAvailable.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/architecture/modern/controller-routing/</guid>
      <description>Symfony controllers &amp;amp; routing Read the Symfony documentation on Controllers and Routing. Controllers are located in src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin folder. Starting on 1.7.3, controllers are being progressively organized in sub-folders following the Back Office menu. For instance, the TaxController is located in src/PrestaShop/Controller/Admin/Improve/International. Same applies to Improve, Sell sections etc.
This is how the directory tree of controllers should look like:
Controller/ └── Admin ├── Configure │ ├── AdvancedParameters │ └── ShopParameters ├── Improve │ ├── Design │ ├── International │ ├── Modules │ ├── Payment │ └── Shipping └── Sell ├── Catalog ├── Customers ├── CustomerService ├── Orders └── Stats Symfony Controllers should be thin by default and have only one responsibility: getting the HTTP Request from the client and returning an HTTP Response.</description>

      <description>The Faceted Search Architecture This document describes the faceted search architecture that is being implemented in PrestaShop 1.7.
Please also read the extensive comments in classes/controller/ProductListingFrontControllerCore, as this document is only a high-level explanation.
The target audience is anybody who wants to develop a well-integrated search module that replaces the way the PrestaShop core searches for products.
At the moment this proof of concept works only on the CategoryController but it is easy to extend to the other product controllers (manufacturers, supplier&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>Modify the TinyMCE configuration  You are able to modify the configuration by using the actionAdminControllerSetMedia hook.
Inside the JS file you added with this hook, you need to create a global object containing your custom configuration:
window.defaultTinyMceConfig = { [...] } and as you can see in the tinymce core file it will load it instead of the default core configuration.
Keep in mind that the config is not completely replaced, it&amp;rsquo;s an Object.</description>

Everything&amp;rsquo;s better on 1.7.4 
 To align a pill with a title, use the parameter title=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;:

      <description>About Webpack  Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
 The main interest of using Webpack is that it will compile all your styles - which we advise you to write using Sass  - into a single CSS file. This way, your theme will make only one HTTP request for this single file, and since your browser will cache it for later re-use, it will even download this file only once.</description>
