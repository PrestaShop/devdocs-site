	"content": "Grid and identifiable object form hooks usage example  Introduction In this tutorial we are going to build module which extends customers list with one extra column which can be toggled. It can have two states - turned on or off. In customer creation and edit form we will add switch which will also manage the same state. By following this tutorial you will learn how to:\n extend modern grids. Grid component extend identifiable object form. identifiable object form  The module created within this tutorial can be found here\nPrerequisites  To be familiar with basic module creation.  Register hooks On module installation the following hooks are being registered:\n actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier - for adding new column to customers grid. actionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier - for modifying customers grid sql. actionCustomerFormBuilderModifier - for adding new field to customers create or edit form field. actionAfterCreateCustomerFormHandler - to execute the saving process of added field from the module. actionAfterUpdateCustomerFormHandler - to execute the update process of added field from the module.  \u0026lt;?php public function install() { return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionCustomerFormBuilderModifier\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionAfterCreateCustomerFormHandler\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionAfterUpdateCustomerFormHandler\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;installTables() ; }  Hooks actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier and actionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier are built using grid id which in this case is Customer. If you want to use hook for any other grid You can check any definition factory service in PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory to see available grid ids. Grid id is returned by getId() method. Hooks actionCustomerFormBuilderModifier,actionAfterCreateCustomerFormHandler and actionAfterUpdateCustomerFormHandler are built using unique identifier which in this case is Customer is retrieved from its form type CustomerType. E.g id retrieved from ManufacturerType will be Manufacturer. Some types might use function getBlockPrefix to retrieve the unique id Adding new column to customers grid Extending grid definition and filters \u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\GridDefinitionInterface; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Column\\Type\\Common\\ToggleColumn; use PrestaShopBundle\\Form\\Admin\\Type\\YesAndNoChoiceType; class Ps_DemoCQRSHooksUsage extends Module { // ...  /** * Hook allows to modify Customers grid definition. * This hook is a right place to add/remove columns or actions (bulk, grid). * * @param array $params */ public function hookActionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier(array $params) { /** @var GridDefinitionInterface $definition */ $definition = $params[\u0026#39;definition\u0026#39;]; $translator = $this-\u0026gt;getTranslator(); $definition -\u0026gt;getColumns() -\u0026gt;addAfter( \u0026#39;optin\u0026#39;, (new ToggleColumn(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName($translator-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Allowed for review\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Ps_DemoCQRSHooksUsage\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setOptions([ \u0026#39;field\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;primary_field\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;id_customer\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ps_democqrshooksusage_toggle_is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;route_param_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;customerId\u0026#39;, ]) ) ; $definition-\u0026gt;getFilters()-\u0026gt;add( (new Filter(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, YesAndNoChoiceType::class)) -\u0026gt;setAssociatedColumn(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;) ); } // ... } This hook, through $params array, received GridDefinition that defines how the grid is rendered. See Grid definition for more information.\nIn this sample a new toggable column which determines if the customer is eligible to review products is added just after another column which has id optin. The sample code also demonstrates how add new filter.\nCreating route for toggle column ToggleColumn - used to display booleans, it will display an icon instead of the value. If user clicks on it, this triggers a toggle of the boolean value. More information about this column and all available parameters can be found here.\nAs in this sample module we are creating ToggleColumn we need to configure the route in which the toggling action will be performed. Indeed when the end-user clicks on this column, an ajax request is performed and must reach one new controller to handle the action (here: toggle a value on and off).\nIf you only want to display data then this step can be skipped. E.g you are creating DataColumn. See Column references for full list of grid columns available.\n Create controller DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin\\CustomerReviewController:  \u0026lt;?php namespace DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class CustomerReviewController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { }  Create controller action:  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nYou can find full implementation here which uses CQRS pattern to toggle the reviewer state. More about it here.\n \u0026lt;?php namespace DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class CustomerReviewController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { public function toggleIsAllowedForReviewAction($customerId) { // updating reviewer state can be handled here  return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_customers_index\u0026#39;); } }  As this is a Symfony controller, we must configure the related routing (read more about symfony routing), which means create a route in ps_democqrshooksusage/config/routes.yml file:  ps_democqrshooksusage_toggle_is_allowed_for_review:path:demo-cqrs-hook-usage/{customerId}/toggle-is-allowed-for-reviewmethods:[POST]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin\\CustomerReviewController::toggleIsAllowedForReviewAction\u0026#39;requirements:customerId:\\d+Route name ps_democqrshooksusage_toggle_is_allowed_for_review matches the one that was passed as mandatory option when creating the ToggleColumn.\nExtending grid query builder By just extending grid definition we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to display any data since we need to fetch it first. Luckily, we can add additional sql conditions by extending doctrine\u0026rsquo;s query builder.\n\u0026lt;?php use Doctrine\\DBAL\\Query\\QueryBuilder; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Search\\Filters\\CustomerFilters; class Ps_DemoCQRSHooksUsage extends Module { // ...  /** * Hook allows to modify Customers query builder and add custom sql statements. * * @param array $params */ public function hookActionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier(array $params) { /** @var QueryBuilder $searchQueryBuilder */ $searchQueryBuilder = $params[\u0026#39;search_query_builder\u0026#39;]; /** @var CustomerFilters $searchCriteria */ $searchCriteria = $params[\u0026#39;search_criteria\u0026#39;]; $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;addSelect( \u0026#39;IF(dcur.`is_allowed_for_review` IS NULL,0,dcur.`is_allowed_for_review`) AS `is_allowed_for_review`\u0026#39; ); $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;leftJoin( \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;`\u0026#39; . pSQL(_DB_PREFIX_) . \u0026#39;democqrshooksusage_reviewer`\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dcur\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dcur.`id_customer` = c.`id_customer`\u0026#39; ); if (\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39; === $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderBy()) { $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;orderBy(\u0026#39;dcur.`is_allowed_for_review`\u0026#39;, $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderWay()); } foreach ($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getFilters() as $filterName =\u0026gt; $filterValue) { if (\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39; === $filterName) { $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;andWhere(\u0026#39;dcur.`is_allowed_for_review` = :is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;); $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;setParameter(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, $filterValue); if (!$filterValue) { $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;orWhere(\u0026#39;dcur.`is_allowed_for_review` IS NULL\u0026#39;); } } } } // ... } This sample demonstrates how to extend sql of the customers grid. From our custom database table democqrshooksusage_reviewer we fetch the result of field is_allowed_for_review. This name must match the id we added in the grid definition.

	"content": "Grid and identifiable object form hooks usage example  Introduction In this tutorial we are going to build module which extends customers list with one extra column which can be toggled. It can have two states - turned on or off. In customer creation and edit form we will add switch which will also manage the same state. By following this tutorial you will learn how to:\n extend modern grids. Grid component extend identifiable object form. identifiable object form  The module created within this tutorial can be found here\nPrerequisites  To be familiar with basic module creation.  Register hooks On module installation the following hooks are being registered:\n actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier - for adding new column to customers grid. actionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier - for modifying customers grid sql. actionCustomerFormBuilderModifier - for adding new field to customers create or edit form field. actionAfterCreateCustomerFormHandler - to execute the saving process of added field from the module. actionAfterUpdateCustomerFormHandler - to execute the update process of added field from the module.  \u0026lt;?php public function install() { return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionCustomerFormBuilderModifier\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionAfterCreateCustomerFormHandler\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionAfterUpdateCustomerFormHandler\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;installTables() ; }  Hooks actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier and actionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier are built using grid id which in this case is Customer. If you want to use hook for any other grid You can check any definition factory service in PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory to see available grid ids. Grid id is returned by getId() method. Hooks actionCustomerFormBuilderModifier,actionAfterCreateCustomerFormHandler and actionAfterUpdateCustomerFormHandler are built using unique identifier which in this case is Customer is retrieved from its form type CustomerType. E.g id retrieved from ManufacturerType will be Manufacturer. Some types might use function getBlockPrefix to retrieve the unique id Adding new column to customers grid Extending grid definition and filters \u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\GridDefinitionInterface; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Column\\Type\\Common\\ToggleColumn; use PrestaShopBundle\\Form\\Admin\\Type\\YesAndNoChoiceType; class Ps_DemoCQRSHooksUsage extends Module { // ...  /** * Hook allows to modify Customers grid definition. * This hook is a right place to add/remove columns or actions (bulk, grid). * * @param array $params */ public function hookActionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier(array $params) { /** @var GridDefinitionInterface $definition */ $definition = $params[\u0026#39;definition\u0026#39;]; $translator = $this-\u0026gt;getTranslator(); $definition -\u0026gt;getColumns() -\u0026gt;addAfter( \u0026#39;optin\u0026#39;, (new ToggleColumn(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName($translator-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Allowed for review\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Ps_DemoCQRSHooksUsage\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setOptions([ \u0026#39;field\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;primary_field\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;id_customer\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ps_democqrshooksusage_toggle_is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;route_param_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;customerId\u0026#39;, ]) ) ; $definition-\u0026gt;getFilters()-\u0026gt;add( (new Filter(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, YesAndNoChoiceType::class)) -\u0026gt;setAssociatedColumn(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;) ); } // ... } This hook, through $params array, received GridDefinition that defines how the grid is rendered. See Grid definition for more information.\nIn this sample a new toggable column which determines if the customer is eligible to review products is added just after another column which has id optin. The sample code also demonstrates how add new filter.\nCreating route for toggle column ToggleColumn - used to display booleans, it will display an icon instead of the value. If user clicks on it, this triggers a toggle of the boolean value. More information about this column and all available parameters can be found here.\nAs in this sample module we are creating ToggleColumn we need to configure the route in which the toggling action will be performed. Indeed when the end-user clicks on this column, an ajax request is performed and must reach one new controller to handle the action (here: toggle a value on and off).\nIf you only want to display data then this step can be skipped. E.g you are creating DataColumn. See Column references for full list of grid columns available.\n Create controller DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin\\CustomerReviewController:  \u0026lt;?php namespace DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class CustomerReviewController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { }  Create controller action:  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nYou can find full implementation here which uses CQRS pattern to toggle the reviewer state. More about it here.\n \u0026lt;?php namespace DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class CustomerReviewController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { public function toggleIsAllowedForReviewAction($customerId) { // updating reviewer state can be handled here  return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_customers_index\u0026#39;); } }  As this is a Symfony controller, we must configure the related routing (read more about symfony routing), which means create a route in ps_democqrshooksusage/config/routes.yml file:  ps_democqrshooksusage_toggle_is_allowed_for_review:path:demo-cqrs-hook-usage/{customerId}/toggle-is-allowed-for-reviewmethods:[POST]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;DemoCQRSHooksUsage\\Controller\\Admin\\CustomerReviewController::toggleIsAllowedForReviewAction\u0026#39;requirements:customerId:\\d+Route name ps_democqrshooksusage_toggle_is_allowed_for_review matches the one that was passed as mandatory option when creating the ToggleColumn.\nExtending grid query builder By just extending grid definition we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to display any data since we need to fetch it first. Luckily, we can add additional sql conditions by extending doctrine\u0026rsquo;s query builder.\n\u0026lt;?php use Doctrine\\DBAL\\Query\\QueryBuilder; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Search\\Filters\\CustomerFilters; class Ps_DemoCQRSHooksUsage extends Module { // ...  /** * Hook allows to modify Customers query builder and add custom sql statements. * * @param array $params */ public function hookActionCustomerGridQueryBuilderModifier(array $params) { /** @var QueryBuilder $searchQueryBuilder */ $searchQueryBuilder = $params[\u0026#39;search_query_builder\u0026#39;]; /** @var CustomerFilters $searchCriteria */ $searchCriteria = $params[\u0026#39;search_criteria\u0026#39;]; $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;addSelect( \u0026#39;IF(dcur.`is_allowed_for_review` IS NULL,0,dcur.`is_allowed_for_review`) AS `is_allowed_for_review`\u0026#39; ); $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;leftJoin( \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;`\u0026#39; . pSQL(_DB_PREFIX_) . \u0026#39;democqrshooksusage_reviewer`\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dcur\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dcur.`id_customer` = c.`id_customer`\u0026#39; ); if (\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39; === $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderBy()) { $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;orderBy(\u0026#39;dcur.`is_allowed_for_review`\u0026#39;, $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderWay()); } foreach ($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getFilters() as $filterName =\u0026gt; $filterValue) { if (\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39; === $filterName) { $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;andWhere(\u0026#39;dcur.`is_allowed_for_review` = :is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;); $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;setParameter(\u0026#39;is_allowed_for_review\u0026#39;, $filterValue); if (!$filterValue) { $searchQueryBuilder-\u0026gt;orWhere(\u0026#39;dcur.`is_allowed_for_review` IS NULL\u0026#39;); } } } } // ... } This sample demonstrates how to extend sql of the customers grid. From our custom database table democqrshooksusage_reviewer we fetch the result of field is_allowed_for_review. This name must match the id we added in the grid definition. In order for sorting to work we also add orderBy condition and finally, in order for filters to work where conditions are added if the filter exists in $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getFilters().\nResult After completing the steps above by going to customers list you should see new column \u0026ldquo;allowed for review\u0026rdquo; added.\n Allowed for review column added to customers list   Adding new form field to customer form Modifying customers form builder In this step we are appending to the customers form a new SwitchType form field - its one of many form types which already exist in PrestaShop.

	"content": "How issues are sorted What happens to the issue you have reported PrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA) uses a transparent definition for the criteria used to qualify issues' severity, and how they should be applied through labels on github issues.\nPlease note that severity is to be distinguished from priority. Indeed, severity is used to measure the negative impact that a bug has on a system, a feature, a component or on the project development. It is usually defined by the QA team. As for the priority, it is used to organize all the tasks (bugs, improvements, features, technical tasks) that have to be done in order to meet the project\u0026rsquo;s deadlines.\nIssue Severity Criteria When a new issue is created, the first step is to understand what the problem is and then reproduce it. Once that work is done, the second step is to define the severity of that bug.\nFour severity levels are used: Critical, Major, Minor and Trivial.\nCritical The bug affects critical functionality or critical data and there is no workaround (no way to avoid it). A critical issue affects a very large percentage of users (\u0026gt; 60%) and matches at least one of the following:\n It can lead to data loss, introduce a security vulnerability or break the automatic end to end tests It prevents the essential shop operations or puts your business at great risk  Examples:\n Difficulty accessing the front office or back office (significant slowdown, error during installation or update, fatal error) Difficulty to globally manage categories, products or customers Difficulty to globally place and manage orders  A critical issue should result in a patch version that should be released as soon as possible. PrestaShop 1.7.2.5 is a good example: this patch release fixes two vulnerabilities affecting the Back Office.\nMajor The bug affects major functionality or major data and there is a workaround, but it is not obvious or can be difficult to put in practice.\nA major issue affects a large percentage of users (\u0026gt; 30%) and matches at least one of the following:\n It impacts law compliance It has a strong impact on the usability of the front-office / back-office or blocks another project It is an important problem but not necessarily blocking the main activity of the seller  Examples:\n Being unable to add, configure or delete a theme or a module Difficulty in operating a module properly Impacts the price the customer pays  Minor The bug affects minor functionality or non-critical data and there is a reasonable workaround, even if it can be annoying when using your shop.\nExamples:\n A tolerable slowdown A display problem that prevents users from doing something non-critical (eg: can’t click on an element that can be accessible in another way) An error message displayed in your back-office that can be dismissed Cloning a product doesn\u0026rsquo;t copy all of it\u0026rsquo;s data Inaccurate statistics  Trivial The bug doesn’t affect any functionality or data. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is only an inconvenience without functional impact and it does not even need a workaround.\nExamples:\n Cosmetic issues Wrong translation in a specific language: that can be solved on Crowdin Missing confirmation message after an action A link opened in the same tab instead of a new tab  Issue Prioritization Assessing severity helps to prioritize issues but it is not the only criterion at stake. Given two equally severe issues, how to choose one over the other ?\nPrioritization is done by representatives of the Development team, the Product Management team, and the Quality Assurance team.\nTogether, during regular meetings, they look at the new confirmed issues and they sort them.\nIn order to make sure that a given bug does not damage PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s image nor it affects the confidence merchants can have in PrestaShop, they take special care and strive to make every version of PrestaShop better than the one before. Since no one wants to introduce new bugs while fixing other bugs, regressions (new bugs created accidentally when fixing or improving an existing feature) are usually prioritized higher than older bugs. By doing this, the overall software stability is ever increasing.\nThen the issue\u0026rsquo;s technical complexity is also studied : that is, whether the bug is easy or complex to fix.\nSometimes a smaller bug will be prioritize over a bigger one. This is because a complex bug may require big technical changes which are not suitable until a later version. This may be because a would require applying backwards-incompatible changes (which are bad for module developers), or because it can be better addressed as a part of a larger project – there is no use fixing a bug if the whole feature is due to be revamped in the near future. Also sometimes some bugs will be prioritized just because of the “opportunity cost” of fixing them together, as it is usually easier to fix several bugs within the same component. For instance, during the migration of a BO page to Symfony, the bugs of this page are prioritized higher in order to fix them all at once.\nLast criterion used is the business impact as of course.\nIn the end, handling bugs requires two points of view: micro and macro. Severity analyzes the issue on its own, while Priority analyzes the issue in the context of the whole project.\n (This article was originally published on our blog: Introducing A New Bug Severity Classification)\n"

PrestaShop 1.7.2.5 is a good example: this patch release fixes two vulnerabilities affecting the Back Office.\nMajor The bug affects major functionality or major data and there is a workaround, but it is not obvious or can be difficult to put in practice.\nA major issue affects a large percentage of users (\u0026gt; 30%) and matches at least one of the following:\n It impacts law compliance It has a strong impact on the usability of the front-office / back-office or blocks another project It is an important problem but not necessarily blocking the main activity of the seller  Examples:\n Being unable to add, configure or delete a theme or a module Difficulty in operating a module properly Impacts the price the customer pays  Minor The bug affects minor functionality or non-critical data and there is a reasonable workaround, even if it can be annoying when using your shop.\nExamples:\n A tolerable slowdown A display problem that prevents users from doing something non-critical (eg: can’t click on an element that can be accessible in another way) An error message displayed in your back-office that can be dismissed Cloning a product doesn\u0026rsquo;t copy all of it\u0026rsquo;s data Inaccurate statistics  Trivial The bug doesn’t affect any functionality or data. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is only an inconvenience without functional impact and it does not even need a workaround.\nExamples:\n Cosmetic issues Wrong translation in a specific language: that can be solved on Crowdin Missing confirmation message after an action A link opened in the same tab instead of a new tab  Issue Prioritization Assessing severity helps to prioritize issues but it is not the only criterion at stake. Given two equally severe issues, how to choose one over the other ?\nPrioritization is done by representatives of the Development team, the Product Management team, and the Quality Assurance team.\nTogether, during regular meetings, they look at the new confirmed issues and they sort them.\nIn order to make sure that a given bug does not damage PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s image nor it affects the confidence merchants can have in PrestaShop, they take special care and strive to make every version of PrestaShop better than the one before. Since no one wants to introduce new bugs while fixing other bugs, regressions (new bugs created accidentally when fixing or improving an existing feature) are usually prioritized higher than older bugs. By doing this, the overall software stability is ever increasing.\nThen the issue\u0026rsquo;s technical complexity is also studied : that is, whether the bug is easy or complex to fix.\nSometimes a smaller bug will be prioritize over a bigger one. This is because a complex bug may require big technical changes which are not suitable until a later version. This may be because a would require applying backwards-incompatible changes (which are bad for module developers), or because it can be better addressed as a part of a larger project – there is no use fixing a bug if the whole feature is due to be revamped in the near future. Also sometimes some bugs will be prioritized just because of the “opportunity cost” of fixing them together, as it is usually easier to fix several bugs within the same component. For instance, during the migration of a BO page to Symfony, the bugs of this page are prioritized higher in order to fix them all at once.\nLast criterion used is the business impact as of course.\nIn the end, handling bugs requires two points of view: micro and macro. Severity analyzes the issue on its own, while Priority analyzes the issue in the context of the whole project.\n (This article was originally published on our blog: Introducing A New Bug Severity Classification)\n"

	"content": "How to handle multi lang Doctrine entity  Multi lang fields in PrestaShop A common use case in a CMS (Content Management System) is to handle translatable fields (or multi lang fields). In the legacy model of PrestaShop this is managed via an automatic mechanism and some configuration in the ObjectModel, thus all translatable fields are stored in a dedicated table. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you have a quote table then its translatable fields will be stored in a quote_lang each row being an association between a quote row and a lang row (containing the languages installed on a PrestaShop shop).\nWe are going to use the same strategy here so that developers used to legacy objects will be able to understand the database structure easily as it follows the same architecture. It could also be useful if you want to create a Doctrine entity compatible with a legacy ObjectModel, the structure will remain the same so you could access/edit the data with two different Data layers.\nWhat about doctrine plugins?\nThere are several Doctrine plugins which allows to handle multi lang fields easily but for now no solution has been integrated in PrestaShop, so you will have to handle it \u0026ldquo;manually\u0026rdquo;.\n Namespace and autoload The content of this documentation relies on namespaces which need to be defined in your module\u0026rsquo;s autoload, we won\u0026rsquo;t cover this part here if you need more information please read how to setup composer in a module Example module All the content of this documentation can be found in this Doctrine example module which covers all the content of this page and more:\n Multi lang entities Doctrine repositories Form handling Grid listing Symfony controller Symfony Services   Define your entities This example will be based on an example of quotes from various authors that need to be translated (so that it matches the user\u0026rsquo;s language), these quotes can then be randomly be displayed on the Frontend.\nQuote entity This is the base entity, it contains:\n the author name (no need to translate it) a collection of QuoteLang which contains all the translatable fields using a OneToMany Bidirectional relation the dates of creation and updates (which rely on Doctrine lifecycle callbacks to be filled automatically) the definition of the associated repository PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoDoctrine\\Repository\\QuoteRepository  \u0026lt;?php /** * Copyright since 2007 PrestaShop SA and Contributors * PrestaShop is an International Registered Trademark \u0026amp;

It could also be useful if you want to create a Doctrine entity compatible with a legacy ObjectModel, the structure will remain the same so you could access/edit the data with two different Data layers.\nWhat about doctrine plugins?\nThere are several Doctrine plugins which allows to handle multi lang fields easily but for now no solution has been integrated in PrestaShop, so you will have to handle it \u0026ldquo;manually\u0026rdquo;.\n Namespace and autoload The content of this documentation relies on namespaces which need to be defined in your module\u0026rsquo;s autoload, we won\u0026rsquo;t cover this part here if you need more information please read how to setup composer in a module Example module All the content of this documentation can be found in this Doctrine example module which covers all the content of this page and more:\n Multi lang entities Doctrine repositories Form handling Grid listing Symfony controller Symfony Services   Define your entities This example will be based on an example of quotes from various authors that need to be translated (so that it matches the user\u0026rsquo;s language), these quotes can then be randomly be displayed on the Frontend.\nQuote entity This is the base entity, it contains:\n the author name (no need to translate it) a collection of QuoteLang which contains all the translatable fields using a OneToMany Bidirectional relation the dates of creation and updates (which rely on Doctrine lifecycle callbacks to be filled automatically) the definition of the associated repository PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoDoctrine\\Repository\\QuoteRepository  \u0026lt;?php /** * Copyright since 2007 PrestaShop SA and Contributors * PrestaShop is an International Registered Trademark \u0026amp;

	"content": "How to use Bulk actions in Grid? In addition to displaying data tables, Grid component also comes with a lot of additional functionality. One of it is Bulk actions.\nWhat is Bulk action? Bulk action is action (e.g. Delete, Change status \u0026amp; etc) that can be performed on multiple entries in table. This is a common task when using Grid (e.g. Delete multiple selected Suppliers with a single click).\nHow to add Bulk actions to Grid? Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example from Customers grid definition. It has 3 bulk actions: Enable, Disable \u0026amp; Delete multiple customers. See code example below:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Grid/Definition/Factory/CustomerGridDefinitionFactory.php  final class CustomerGridDefinitionFactory extends AbstractGridDefinitionFactory { // ...  protected function getBulkActions() { return (new BulkActionCollection()) -\u0026gt;add( (new SubmitBulkAction(\u0026#39;enable_selection\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName($this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Enable selection\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Admin.Actions\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setOptions([ \u0026#39;submit_route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_customers_enable_bulk\u0026#39;, ]) ) -\u0026gt;add( (new SubmitBulkAction(\u0026#39;disable_selection\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName($this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Disable selection\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Admin.Actions\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setOptions([ \u0026#39;submit_route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_customers_disable_bulk\u0026#39;, ]) ) -\u0026gt;add((new DeleteCustomersBulkAction(\u0026#39;delete_selection\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName($this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Delete selected\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Admin.Actions\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setOptions([ \u0026#39;customers_bulk_delete_route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_customers_delete_bulk\u0026#39;, ]) ) ; } } As you see, Grid stores Bulk actions in BulkActionCollection object. This means that every Bulk action needed for Grid must be added to BulkActionCollection using add() method.\nHow to add Bulk actions from module? You can add additional Bulk actions to any Grid using hook. You have to follow these steps:\n Register hook action{gridId}GridDefinitionModifier where {gridId} is Grid id (e.g. customer for Customers grid, this means that hook name would be actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier). Implement hook method in your module:  \u0026lt;?php // modules/mymodule/mymodule.php  class MyModule extends Module { // ...  /** * Use hook to add Bulk action for subscribing multiple customers to newsletter */ public function hookActionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier(array $params) { // $params[\u0026#39;definition\u0026#39;] is instance of \\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\GridDefinition  $params[\u0026#39;definition\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;getBulkActions()-\u0026gt;add( (new SubmitBulkAction(\u0026#39;subscribe_newsletter\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName(\u0026#39;Subscribe newsletter\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;setOptions([ // in most cases submit action should be implemented by module  \u0026#39;submit_route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_my_module_customers_bulk_subscribe_newsletter\u0026#39;, ]) ); } } Now you should be able to see new Bulk action available in Customers grid!\nHow to create custom Bulk action? PrestaShop already comes with a bunch of Bulk actions that are available for use in your Grids or for extending PrestaShop grids. However, in some use cases you may find that existing Bulk actions do not fit your needs. Luckily, there is a solution, you can create custom Bulk actions.\nFirst, you need to create Bulk action itself:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/mymodule/src/Grid/Action/Bulk  use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Action\\Bulk\\AbstractBulkAction; // It extends AbstractBulkAction, // but you can also implement \\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Action\\Bulk\\BulkActionInterface // if for some reason you want to avoid using abstract class final class ExportBulkAction extends AbstractBulkAction { public function getType() { return \u0026#39;export\u0026#39;; } protected function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver) { $resolver -\u0026gt;setDefaults([ // fictional action implemented by module to export only selected customers  \u0026#39;submit_route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_my_module_customers_bulk_export\u0026#39;, ]) ; } } Then you need to create template so it can render nicely in your grid.\n{# mymodule/views/PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/Actions/Bulk/export.html.twig #}{# This button should be used with SubmitBulkActionExtension grid extension in Javascript #}\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#39;%s_grid_bulk_action_%s\u0026#39;|format(grid.id, action.id) }}\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;dropdown-item js-bulk-action-submit-btn\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34; data-form-url=\u0026#34;{{ path(action.options.submit_route) }}\u0026#34; data-form-method=\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34; \u0026gt; {{ action.name }}\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; Last thing is to add your newly created Bulk action to Grid\u0026rsquo;s BulkActionCollection and then it should be available in your Grid!\n"

Luckily, there is a solution, you can create custom Bulk actions.\nFirst, you need to create Bulk action itself:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/mymodule/src/Grid/Action/Bulk  use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Action\\Bulk\\AbstractBulkAction; // It extends AbstractBulkAction, // but you can also implement \\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Action\\Bulk\\BulkActionInterface // if for some reason you want to avoid using abstract class final class ExportBulkAction extends AbstractBulkAction { public function getType() { return \u0026#39;export\u0026#39;; } protected function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver) { $resolver -\u0026gt;setDefaults([ // fictional action implemented by module to export only selected customers  \u0026#39;submit_route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_my_module_customers_bulk_export\u0026#39;, ]) ; } } Then you need to create template so it can render nicely in your grid.\n{# mymodule/views/PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/Actions/Bulk/export.html.twig #}{# This button should be used with SubmitBulkActionExtension grid extension in Javascript #}\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#39;%s_grid_bulk_action_%s\u0026#39;|format(grid.id, action.id) }}\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;dropdown-item js-bulk-action-submit-btn\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;button\u0026#34; data-form-url=\u0026#34;{{ path(action.options.submit_route) }}\u0026#34; data-form-method=\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34; \u0026gt; {{ action.name }}\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; Last thing is to add your newly created Bulk action to Grid\u0026rsquo;s BulkActionCollection and then it should be available in your Grid!\n"

Then create composer.json in the root of the module to autoload classes with the namespaces (PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\) we define from the src folder (https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading). Using composer PSR-4 autoload helps us autoload classes without the need to use require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php'; .\nEven though using autoload block in composer.json helps us to autoload classes from the specified folder src with the namespace PrestaShop\\\\Module\\\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\\\ we might have some autoloading issues if we use our classes in our module main file demovieworderhooks.php. For example, we might define a constant if one of our class and use it in demovieworderhooks.php when we will get error: the class is not defined. Then a solution can be including require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php'; before the main module class demovieworderhooks is defined. { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;prestashop/demovieworderhooks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authors\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Name Surname\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;author@email.com\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;autoload\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;psr-4\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;PrestaShop\\\\Module\\\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\\\\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;src/\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prepend-autoloader\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;prestashop-module\u0026#34; } } Then run composer install on the terminal/command line inside /modules/demovieworderhooks/ folder.

For example, we might define a constant if one of our class and use it in demovieworderhooks.php when we will get error: the class is not defined.

	"title": "New translation system",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "New module translation system  The new module translation system is based on the new system introduced in PrestaShop 1.7 for the Core and Native modules. It aims to harmonize translation systems throughout PrestaShop while providing backwards compatibility.\nThis feature is only available for PrestaShop 1.7.6 and later. If you need to support older versions, see the Classic translation system. Vocabulary  Wording – A string that you may want to translate. Translation Domain – A contextual group of wordings, that allows translated a given wording differently according to the context in which they appear.  How it works Similarly to the classic system, the new translation system works in two steps.\n1. Translation functions are used to display your module\u0026rsquo;s wordings in another language PrestaShop provides functions that allow PHP files and Smarty/Twig templates to display translated wordings. By leveraging a list of translation sources (including dictionary files from classic translation), a module can use this feature display a wording in another language during runtime.\n How wordings are translated at runtime   2. Creating module dictionaries The Back Office\u0026rsquo;s Translation page (International \u0026gt; Translations \u0026gt; Modify Translations) is used to generate module dictionaries. It extracts the module\u0026rsquo;s wordings by analyzing its source code, then inspects a list of sources to compile a list of translations, and finally displays a form that allows you to customize or complete those translations in a given language. Once saved, this information is stored in the Database.\n Translation workflow   If your module has already been translated using the classic translation system, the new translation interface can also source translations from your existing classic translation dictionary files. This means that you can keep your old controllers for compatibility with older PrestaShop versions, and add Symfony controllers for 1.7.6+, without losing your previous translations. Using translation To make your module translatable, you need to adapt your module\u0026rsquo;s source code. Find any wording you want to make translatable, then wrap it using the appropriate method as explained below. Once wrapped, your wordings will be ready to be translated through the translation interface.\nBy default, wordings are displayed as originally written.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry if you don\u0026rsquo;t translate everything to all languages right away. Any wording left untranslated will be shown in its original language. Because of this, we suggest writing all your wordings in English, and then translating them to other languages.\n Translation domain An important part of the new translation system is Translation Domains, which replaces the classic system\u0026rsquo;s contextualization. In the new translation system, all wordings must be linked to at least one translation domain.\nWhile the Core and Native modules have clearly defined translation domain naming scheme, non-native modules must respect a specific naming convention:\nModules.Nameofthemodule.Specificpart Translation Domain names are always made of three parts, separated by dots:\n  The first part must always be \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Nameofthemodule\u0026rdquo; is the name of your module, with some rules:\n The first letter must be in upper case, and the rest in lower case (eg. \u0026ldquo;MyModule\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;Mymodule\u0026rdquo;) Only word characters (A-z, 0-9) are supported.\nMake sure that the technical name of your module does not contain contains underscores (_) or any other unsupported symbol, or else translation may not work. If your module name starts with ps_, that part must be removed. This is an exception to the previous rule.    \u0026ldquo;Specificpart\u0026rdquo; allows for contextualization and can be set to whatever you like, following this rules:\n The first letter must be in upper case, and the rest in lower case. Symbols like dots, dashes and underscores are allowed (but discouraged). If you target 1.7.8 and over, consider using the Native module conventions (\u0026ldquo;Admin\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Shop\u0026rdquo;). If you want to use previously-generated classic translation dictionary files for backward compatibility, you need to follow a specific naming convention (explained below).    Backward compatibility If you want your module to be compatible with previously-generated classic translation dictionary files, then the third component of the Translation domain must be set to the name of the file where the wording is used, respecting the following rules:\n The first letter must be in upper case, and the rest in lower case If the file extension is .tpl, the extension must be removed If the file name ends in \u0026ldquo;controller\u0026rdquo;, that part must be removed as well.  Examples Assuming your module is called \u0026ldquo;my_module\u0026rdquo;:\n   File where the wording is used Expected translation domain     my_module.php Modules.Mymodule.My_module.php   SomeFile.php Modules.Mymodule.Somefile.php   a_certain_template.tpl Modules.Mymodule.A_certain_template   ps_somefile.tpl Modules.Mymodule.Ps_somefile   another-template.html.twig Modules.Mymodule.Another-template.html.twig    You can find more examples in the test fixtures for DomainHelper.\n PHP files In PHP files, translation is performed using the module\u0026rsquo;s trans() method.\nThis method takes four parameters:\n $id – The wording you want to translate. $parameters – An array of replacements, if any. (Learn more about translation placeholders). $domain – The translation domain for that wording, as explained above. $locale – (optional) The locale identifier (eg. \u0026ldquo;en-US\u0026rdquo;) if you want to translate in a different language than the current one.  Now let\u0026rsquo;s see some examples on how to use it.\nModule\u0026rsquo;s main class When translating wordings in the module\u0026rsquo;s main class, since it extends the Module class, you can simply call $this-\u0026gt;trans().\n\u0026lt;?php // file: mymodule.php  class mymodule extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Mymodule\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Mymodule\u0026#39;); } } Since the module is called MyModule, the translation domain should be Modules.Mymodule.Mymodule. The third part matches the file name, which is also \u0026ldquo;mymodule\u0026rdquo;.\nModule controllers ModuleAdminController and ModuleFrontController can access the module instance via the $this-\u0026gt;module property.\n\u0026lt;?php // file: controllers/front/something.php  class MymoduleSomethingModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function initContent() { $this-\u0026gt;title = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My module title\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Something\u0026#39;); } } Symfony controllers work exactly the same as the Core\u0026rsquo;s. Just use $this-\u0026gt;trans method.\nBe aware that in symfony controllers, the second and third arguments have been swapped to make $replacements optional. \u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\Module\\MyModule; class SomeAdminController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { public function someAction() { $this-\u0026gt;text = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some text being translated\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Admin\u0026#39;); } } Other classes Other classes will need to retrieve the module\u0026rsquo;s instance somehow. We recommend passing it as a parameter in the constructor and storing it for later use.\n\u0026lt;?php class CustomModuleClass { private $module; public function __construct(Module $module) { $this-\u0026gt;module = $module } public function foo() { $this-\u0026gt;text = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My text to translate\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Custommoduleclass\u0026#39;); } } If you really need to, you can also retrieve a new instance of your module using Module::getInstanceByName('mymodulename'). This should be avoided though, as it\u0026rsquo;s not a good practice.\nTemplates Twig files Wordings in Twig .twig files can be translated using the trans filter. It works similarly as the trans() method described above for PHP files:\n{# file: something.twig #}{{ \u0026#39;Welcome to this page!\u0026#39;|trans({}, \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Admin\u0026#39;) }}The first parameter can be used to replace tokens in your wording after it\u0026rsquo;s translated:\n{{ \u0026#39;Hello %username%!\u0026#39;|trans({\u0026#39;%username%\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;}, \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Admin\u0026#39;) }}Smarty files Wordings in Smarty .tpl files can be translated using the {l} function call, which Smarty will replace by the translation in the current language.\nThis function accepts three parameters:\n s – The wording to be translated. d – The translation domain. sprintf – Optional, it can be used to interpolate variables in your wording.  For instance, translating the string \u0026ldquo;Welcome to this page!\u0026rdquo; can be done like this:\n{* file: somefile.tpl *}{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome to this page!\u0026#39; d=\u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Somefile\u0026#39;}You can replace placeholders in your translated wordings using the sprintf parameter:\n{l s=\u0026#39;Hello %username%!\u0026#39; sprintf=[\u0026#39;%username%\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;] d=\u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Somefile\u0026#39;}}} Translating your module Modules must opt-in to become translatable using the new Back Office translation interface. This can be done by declaring the following function on your module\u0026rsquo;s main class:\n\u0026lt;?php public function isUsingNewTranslationSystem() { return true; } After this:\n Go to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page under the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; menu, In the \u0026ldquo;Modify translations\u0026rdquo; section, find the \u0026ldquo;Type of translation\u0026rdquo; drop-down and select \u0026ldquo;Installed modules translations\u0026rdquo;, Choose the module you want to translate. Choose the language you want to translate the module into. The destination language must already be installed to enable translation in it. Click the \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo; button.  You will be presented with a page that displays all the wordings for the selected module, grouped by translation domain.\nOnce saved, translations are stored in the database in the table ps_translations.\nMaking your wordings appear in the translation interface The translation interface relies on code analysis to \u0026ldquo;discover\u0026rdquo; wordings for translation. Therefore, when declaring wordings in your code, some care is needed in order to make sure they can be discovered.\n  The translation interface only detects wordings used through the trans() function, the {l} Smarty tag, and the trans Twig filter. Therefore, they must be declared in a PHP, TPL, or TWIG file. They will be detected regardless of whether that code is actually used in runtime or not.\n  Always use literal values, not variables, with the trans() function, the {l} Smarty tag, and trans Twig filter. Although variables are interpreted at runtime, they won\u0026rsquo;t be understood by the code analyzer, which only supports literals. Passing variables to these methods will prevent those wordings from appearing in the translation interface.\n  Example:\n\u0026lt;?php // literal values will work $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Something\u0026#39;); // dynamic content can be injected using placeholders \u0026amp; replacements $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some wording with %foo%\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;%foo%\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $dynamicContent], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Bar\u0026#39;); // this won\u0026#39;t work, the interpreter will ignore variables $wording = \u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;; $domain = \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Foo\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;trans($wording, [], $domain); // this will yield unexpected results $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some \u0026#39;. $var . \u0026#39; wording\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Foo\u0026#39;); // dynamic behavior, like aliasing the trans() function, won\u0026#39;t work well either function translate($wording) { $this-\u0026gt;trans($wording, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Foo\u0026#39;); } In Twig files, you can use trans_default_domain to set up your default domain. Keep in mind this works on a per-file basis:\n{% trans_default_domain \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Foo\u0026#39; %}{{ \u0026#39;Hello world\u0026#39;|trans }}{{ \u0026#39;Something else\u0026#39;|trans }}Distributing your translations Exporting translations  Since PrestaShop 1.7.8, you can export all the module\u0026rsquo;s translations into XLF files that you can distribute with your module.\nTo export the translation files:\n  Go to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page under the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; menu,\n  In the \u0026ldquo;Export translations\u0026rdquo; section:\n Choose a language, Select \u0026ldquo;Installed modules translations\u0026rdquo;, then the module you want to export, Click on \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo;    You can distribute the downloaded dictionaries by placing the extracted files in your module\u0026rsquo;s translations folder, like this:\n. └── mymodule/ └── translations/ ├── fr_FR/ │ ├── ModulesMymoduleFoo.fr_FR.xlf │ └── ModulesMymoduleBar.fr_FR.xlf └── en_US/ ├── ModulesMymoduleFoo.en_US.xlf └── ModulesMymoduleBar.en_US.xlf  Note that these files will only work with PrestaShop 1.7.8 and over. If you need to ensure compatibility with previous versions, read below. Before 1.7.8 If you need to distribute backward-compatible translations, you can either write classic dictionary files manually, or export your module\u0026rsquo;s wordings from the database into a file, then import it during the module\u0026rsquo;s install process.\nIf you choose to export wordings from the database, you can easily extract your module\u0026rsquo;s wordings from the ps_translation table by filtering domains that start with ModulesYourmodulename*. When inserting the translations in the destination shop, remember to set the appropriate value for id_lang according to the destination shop\u0026rsquo;s language configuration (see table ps_lang) .\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "New module translation system  The new module translation system is based on the new system introduced in PrestaShop 1.7 for the Core and Native modules. It aims to harmonize translation systems throughout PrestaShop while providing backwards compatibility.\nThis feature is only available for PrestaShop 1.7.6 and later. If you need to support older versions, see the Classic translation system. Vocabulary  Wording – A string that you may want to translate. Translation Domain – A contextual group of wordings, that allows translated a given wording differently according to the context in which they appear.  How it works Similarly to the classic system, the new translation system works in two steps.\n1. Translation functions are used to display your module\u0026rsquo;s wordings in another language PrestaShop provides functions that allow PHP files and Smarty/Twig templates to display translated wordings. By leveraging a list of translation sources (including dictionary files from classic translation), a module can use this feature display a wording in another language during runtime.\n How wordings are translated at runtime   2. Creating module dictionaries The Back Office\u0026rsquo;s Translation page (International \u0026gt; Translations \u0026gt; Modify Translations) is used to generate module dictionaries. It extracts the module\u0026rsquo;s wordings by analyzing its source code, then inspects a list of sources to compile a list of translations, and finally displays a form that allows you to customize or complete those translations in a given language. Once saved, this information is stored in the Database.\n Translation workflow   If your module has already been translated using the classic translation system, the new translation interface can also source translations from your existing classic translation dictionary files. This means that you can keep your old controllers for compatibility with older PrestaShop versions, and add Symfony controllers for 1.7.6+, without losing your previous translations. Using translation To make your module translatable, you need to adapt your module\u0026rsquo;s source code. Find any wording you want to make translatable, then wrap it using the appropriate method as explained below. Once wrapped, your wordings will be ready to be translated through the translation interface.\nBy default, wordings are displayed as originally written.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry if you don\u0026rsquo;t translate everything to all languages right away. Any wording left untranslated will be shown in its original language. Because of this, we suggest writing all your wordings in English, and then translating them to other languages.\n Translation domain An important part of the new translation system is Translation Domains, which replaces the classic system\u0026rsquo;s contextualization. In the new translation system, all wordings must be linked to at least one translation domain.\nWhile the Core and Native modules have clearly defined translation domain naming scheme, non-native modules must respect a specific naming convention:\nModules.Nameofthemodule.Specificpart Translation Domain names are always made of three parts, separated by dots:\n  The first part must always be \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Nameofthemodule\u0026rdquo; is the name of your module, with some rules:\n The first letter must be in upper case, and the rest in lower case (eg. \u0026ldquo;MyModule\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;Mymodule\u0026rdquo;) Only word characters (A-z, 0-9) are supported.\nMake sure that the technical name of your module does not contain contains underscores (_) or any other unsupported symbol, or else translation may not work. If your module name starts with ps_, that part must be removed. This is an exception to the previous rule.    \u0026ldquo;Specificpart\u0026rdquo; allows for contextualization and can be set to whatever you like, following this rules:\n The first letter must be in upper case, and the rest in lower case. Symbols like dots, dashes and underscores are allowed (but discouraged). If you target 1.7.8 and over, consider using the Native module conventions (\u0026ldquo;Admin\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Shop\u0026rdquo;). If you want to use previously-generated classic translation dictionary files for backward compatibility, you need to follow a specific naming convention (explained below).    Backward compatibility If you want your module to be compatible with previously-generated classic translation dictionary files, then the third component of the Translation domain must be set to the name of the file where the wording is used, respecting the following rules:\n The first letter must be in upper case, and the rest in lower case If the file extension is .tpl, the extension must be removed If the file name ends in \u0026ldquo;controller\u0026rdquo;, that part must be removed as well.  Examples Assuming your module is called \u0026ldquo;my_module\u0026rdquo;:\n   File where the wording is used Expected translation domain     my_module.php Modules.Mymodule.My_module.php   SomeFile.php Modules.Mymodule.Somefile.php   a_certain_template.tpl Modules.Mymodule.A_certain_template   ps_somefile.tpl Modules.Mymodule.Ps_somefile   another-template.html.twig Modules.Mymodule.Another-template.html.twig    You can find more examples in the test fixtures for DomainHelper.\n PHP files In PHP files, translation is performed using the module\u0026rsquo;s trans() method.\nThis method takes four parameters:\n $id – The wording you want to translate. $parameters – An array of replacements, if any. (Learn more about translation placeholders). $domain – The translation domain for that wording, as explained above. $locale – (optional) The locale identifier (eg. \u0026ldquo;en-US\u0026rdquo;) if you want to translate in a different language than the current one.  Now let\u0026rsquo;s see some examples on how to use it.\nModule\u0026rsquo;s main class When translating wordings in the module\u0026rsquo;s main class, since it extends the Module class, you can simply call $this-\u0026gt;trans().\n\u0026lt;?php // file: mymodule.php  class mymodule extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Mymodule\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Mymodule\u0026#39;); } } Since the module is called MyModule, the translation domain should be Modules.Mymodule.Mymodule. The third part matches the file name, which is also \u0026ldquo;mymodule\u0026rdquo;.\nModule controllers ModuleAdminController and ModuleFrontController can access the module instance via the $this-\u0026gt;module property.\n\u0026lt;?php // file: controllers/front/something.php  class MymoduleSomethingModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function initContent() { $this-\u0026gt;title = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My module title\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Something\u0026#39;); } } Symfony controllers work exactly the same as the Core\u0026rsquo;s. Just use $this-\u0026gt;trans method.\nBe aware that in symfony controllers, the second and third arguments have been swapped to make $replacements optional. \u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\Module\\MyModule; class SomeAdminController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { public function someAction() { $this-\u0026gt;text = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some text being translated\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Admin\u0026#39;); } } Other classes Other classes will need to retrieve the module\u0026rsquo;s instance somehow. We recommend passing it as a parameter in the constructor and storing it for later use.\n\u0026lt;?php class CustomModuleClass { private $module; public function __construct(Module $module) { $this-\u0026gt;module = $module } public function foo() { $this-\u0026gt;text = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My text to translate\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Custommoduleclass\u0026#39;); } } If you really need to, you can also retrieve a new instance of your module using Module::getInstanceByName('mymodulename'). This should be avoided though, as it\u0026rsquo;s not a good practice.\nTemplates Twig files Wordings in Twig .twig files can be translated using the trans filter. It works similarly as the trans() method described above for PHP files:\n{# file: something.twig #}{{ \u0026#39;Welcome to this page!\u0026#39;|trans({}, \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Admin\u0026#39;) }}The first parameter can be used to replace tokens in your wording after it\u0026rsquo;s translated:\n{{ \u0026#39;Hello %username%!\u0026#39;|trans({\u0026#39;%username%\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;}, \u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Admin\u0026#39;) }}Smarty files Wordings in Smarty .tpl files can be translated using the {l} function call, which Smarty will replace by the translation in the current language.\nThis function accepts three parameters:\n s – The wording to be translated. d – The translation domain. sprintf – Optional, it can be used to interpolate variables in your wording.  For instance, translating the string \u0026ldquo;Welcome to this page!\u0026rdquo; can be done like this:\n{* file: somefile.tpl *}{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome to this page!\u0026#39; d=\u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Somefile\u0026#39;}You can replace placeholders in your translated wordings using the sprintf parameter:\n{l s=\u0026#39;Hello %username%!\u0026#39; sprintf=[\u0026#39;%username%\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;John\u0026#39;] d=\u0026#39;Modules.Mymodule.Somefile\u0026#39;}}} Translating your module Modules must opt-in to become translatable using the new Back Office translation interface. This can be done by declaring the following function on your module\u0026rsquo;s main class:\n\u0026lt;?php public function isUsingNewTranslationSystem() { return true; } After this:\n Go to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page under the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; menu, In the \u0026ldquo;Modify translations\u0026rdquo; section, find the \u0026ldquo;Type of translation\u0026rdquo; drop-down and select \u0026ldquo;Installed modules translations\u0026rdquo;, Choose the module you want to translate. Choose the language you want to translate the module into. The destination language must already be installed to enable translation in it. Click the \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo; button.  You will be presented with a page that displays all the wordings for the selected module, grouped by translation domain.\nOnce saved, translations are stored in the database in the table ps_translations.\nMaking your wordings appear in the translation interface The translation interface relies on code analysis to \u0026ldquo;discover\u0026rdquo; wordings for translation.

	"title": "Tutorial: Creating your first module",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Tutorial: Creating your first module Before you start writing code for your PrestaShop module, we recommend reading PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Coding standards. Configuring your IDE hints or using automated tools can help you make sure you follow the project\u0026rsquo;s standards properly. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a simple first module; this will enable us to better describe its structure. We will name it \u0026ldquo;My module\u0026rdquo;.\nFirst, create the module\u0026rsquo;s folder, in PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s /modules folder. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it mymodule. This will be the module\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;technical\u0026rdquo; name.\nTechnical names can only accept lower case alphanumeric characters ([a-z0-9]). Although accepted, we strongly discourage using underscores because they don\u0026rsquo;t work with translation domains. This folder must contain the main file, a PHP file of the same name as the folder, which will handle most of the processing: mymodule.php.\nThat is enough for a very basic module. Obviously, more files and folders can be added later, if needed.\nThe constant test The main mymodule.php file must start with the following test:\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } This checks for the presence of an always-existing PrestaShop constant (its version number), and if it does not exist, it stops the module from loading. The sole purpose of this is to prevent malicious visitors to load this file directly.\nNote that, as required by PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Coding Standards (see above), we do not use a closing PHP tag.\nThe main class The main file must contain the module\u0026rsquo;s main class.\nIf you need to add more classes later, we suggest writing one single class per file. That main class must bear the same name as the module and its folder, in CamelCase. In our example: MyModule. Furthermore, that class must extend the Module class, in order to inherit all its methods and attributes.\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } class MyModule extends Module { } It can just as well extend any class derived from Module, for specific needs: PaymentModule, ModuleGridEngine, ModuleGraph, etc.\nAt this stage, if you place the module\u0026rsquo;s folder on the /modules folder, the module can already be seen in the \u0026ldquo;Module Catalog\u0026rdquo; page in the back office, in the \u0026ldquo;Other modules\u0026rdquo; section – albeit with no real name nor thumbnail.\nThe constructor method Now, let\u0026rsquo;s fill the class' code block with the essential constructor lines. Since the constructor is the first method to be called when the module is loaded by PrestaShop, this is the best place to set its details.\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } class MyModule extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;tab = \u0026#39;front_office_features\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;version = \u0026#39;1.0.0\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;author = \u0026#39;Firstname Lastname\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;need_instance = 0; $this-\u0026gt;ps_versions_compliancy = [ \u0026#39;min\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.6\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;max\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.7.99\u0026#39;, ]; $this-\u0026gt;bootstrap = true; parent::__construct(); $this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;confirmUninstall = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Are you sure you want to uninstall?\u0026#39;); if (!Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;)) { $this-\u0026gt;warning = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;No name provided\u0026#39;); } } } Let\u0026rsquo;s examine each line\u0026hellip;\n$this-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;tab = \u0026#39;front_office_features\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;version = \u0026#39;1.0\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;author = \u0026#39;Firstname Lastname\u0026#39;; This section assigns a handful of attributes to the class instance ($this):\n The name attribute serves as an internal identifier (technical name). The value MUST be the same as the module\u0026rsquo;s folder and main class file. Only lower case letters and numbers are accepted. The tab attribute contains the section that shall contain this module in the Module Manager section in the Back office (see list of available sections). We choose front_office_features because our module will mostly have an impact on the front-end. The version attribute contains the version number for the module, displayed in the modules list. We recommend following the Semantic Versioning specification. The author attribute, as you can imagine contains the author\u0026rsquo;s name. It is displayed as-is in the PrestaShop modules list.  Let\u0026rsquo;s continue with the next line in this block of code:\n$this-\u0026gt;need_instance = 0; $this-\u0026gt;ps_versions_compliancy = [ \u0026#39;min\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.6\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;max\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.7.99\u0026#39; ]; $this-\u0026gt;bootstrap = true; This section handles the relationship with the module and its environment (namely, PrestaShop):\n The need_instance attribute Indicates whether to load the module\u0026rsquo;s class when displaying the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; page in the back office. If set at 0, the module will not be loaded, and therefore will spend less resources to generate the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; page. If your module needs to display a warning message in the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; page, then you must set this attribute to 1. The ps_versions_compliancy attribute indicates which version of PrestaShop this module is compatible with. In the example above, we are defining the compatibility range between 1.6.0.0 and 1.7.99.0. The bootstrap attribute indicates that the module\u0026rsquo;s template files have been built with PrestaShop 1.6\u0026rsquo;s bootstrap tools in mind.  Next, we call the constructor method from the parent PHP class:\nparent::__construct(); This will trigger a lot of actions from PrestaShop that you do not need to know about at this point.\nThis method call must be placed after the definition of $this-\u0026gt;name variable and before any use of translation.\nThe next section deals with text strings, which are encapsulated in PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s translation method, l():\n$this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;confirmUninstall = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Are you sure you want to uninstall?\u0026#39;); if (!Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;)) { $this-\u0026gt;warning = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;No name provided.\u0026#39;); } These lines respectively assign:\n A name for the module, which will be displayed in the back office\u0026rsquo;s modules list. A description for the module, which will be displayed in the back office\u0026rsquo;s modules list. A message, asking the administrator if they really wants to uninstall the module. This is used in the uninstallation process. A warning that the module doesn\u0026rsquo;t have its MYMODULE_NAME database value set yet (this last point being specific to our example, as we will see later).  The constructor method is now complete. You are free to add more to it later if necessary, but this the bare minimum for a working module.\nNow go to your back office\u0026rsquo;s Module Catalog page (found at \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Module Catalog\u0026rdquo;) and search \u0026ldquo;mymodule\u0026rdquo;. The module is visible in the list, with its information displayed – and no icon for now.\nYou can install the module, but it does not do anything yet.\nBuilding the install() and uninstall() methods Some modules have more needs than just using PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s features in special ways. Your module might need to perform actions on installation, such as checking PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s settings or to registering its own settings in the database. Likewise, if you changed things in the database on installation, it is highly recommended to change them back (or remove them) when uninstalling the module.\nThe install() and uninstall() methods make it possible to control what happens when the store administrator installs or uninstalls the module. They must be included in the main class' block of code (in our example, the MyModule class) – at the same level as the constructor method.\nThe install() method Here is the bare minimum for the install() method:\npublic function install() { return parent::install(); } In this first and extremely simplistic incarnation, this method does the minimum needed: return what\u0026rsquo;s returned by the Module class' install() method, which returns either true if the module is correctly installed, or false otherwise. As it is, if we had not created that method, the superclass' method would have been called instead anyway, making the end result identical. Nevertheless, we must mention this method, because it will be very useful once we have to perform checks and actions during the module\u0026rsquo;s installation process: creating SQL tables, copying files, creating configuration variables, etc.\nThere are many things you can do to expand the install() method to perform installation checks. In the following example, we perform the following tasks during installation:\n Check that the Multistore feature is enabled, and if so, set the current context to all shops on this installation of PrestaShop. Ensure that the base install process is successful. Ensure that the module can be attached to the leftColumn hook. Ensure that the module can be attached to the header hook. Ensure the value of the MYMODULE_NAME configuration setting can be set to \u0026ldquo;my friend\u0026rdquo;.  public function install() { if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) { Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); } return ( parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;leftColumn\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;header\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;my friend\u0026#39;) ); } If any of the lines in the testing block fails, the method returns false and the installation is aborted.\nThe uninstall() method The uninstall() method follow the same logic as install(). Here is the bare minimum implementation:\npublic function uninstall() { return parent::uninstall(); } Building on this foundation, we want an uninstall() method that would delete the data added to the database during the installation (MYMODULE_NAME configuration setting). This method would look like this:\npublic function uninstall() { return ( parent::uninstall() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Configuration::deleteByName(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;) ); } The Configuration object As you can see, our three blocks of code (__construct(), install() and uninstall()) all make use of a new object, Configuration.\nThis is a PrestaShop-specific object that allows to easily manage all the shop\u0026rsquo;s settings. It stores its data on the ps_configuration database table.\nThe main methods This component has three main methods, allowing you to perform basic CRUD operations:\n Configuration::get('myVariable') Retrieves a specific value from the database. Configuration::updateValue('myVariable', $value) Updates an existing setting with a new value. If the setting does not yet exist, it creates it with that value. Configuration::deleteByName('myVariable') Deletes the setting.  Note that when using updateValue(), the content of $value can be anything, be it a string, a number, a serialized PHP array or a JSON object. As long as you properly code the data handling function, anything goes. For instance, here is how to handle a PHP array using the Configuration object:\n\u0026lt;?php // Storing a serialized array. Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_SETTINGS\u0026#39;, serialize([true, true, false])); // Retrieving the array. $mySettings = unserialize(Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_SETTINGS\u0026#39;)); As you can see, this in a very useful and easy-to-use object, and you will certainly use it in many situations. Most native modules use it too for their own settings.\nYou can read more about this component in Configuration storage. Retrieving external values from the ps_configuration data table You are not limited to your own variables: PrestaShop stores all its own configuration settings in the ps_configuration database table. There are literally hundreds of settings, and you can access them just as easily as you would access your own. For instance:\n Configuration::get('PS_LANG_DEFAULT'): retrieves the ID for the default language. Configuration::get('PS_TIMEZONE'): retrieves the name of the current timezone, in standard TZ format (see: List of tz database time zones). Configuration::get('PS_DISTANCE_UNIT'): retrieves the default distance unit (\u0026ldquo;km\u0026rdquo; for kilometers, etc.). Configuration::get('PS_SHOP_EMAIL'): retrieves the main contact e-mail address. Configuration::get('PS_NB_DAYS_NEW_PRODUCT'): retrieves the number of days during which a newly-added product is considered \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; by PrestaShop.  Dive into the ps_configuration table to discover many other settings!\nThe Shop object The install() method also references this:\nif (Shop::isFeatureActive()) { Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); } As said earlier, here we check if the Multistore feature is enabled, and if so, set the current execution context to \u0026ldquo;all shops\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Shop object helps you work with multistore. We will not dive in the specifics here, but will simply present the two methods that are used in this sample code:\n Shop::isFeatureActive(): This simply checks whether the multistore feature is active or not, and if at least two stores are presently activated. Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL): This changes the context in order to apply coming changes to all existing stores instead of only the current store.  The Shop Context is explained in more details in the Multistore documentation.\nThe icon file To put the finishing touch to this basic module, you should add an icon, which will be displayed next to the module\u0026rsquo;s name in the back office modules list. In case your module has been built for a prominent service, having that service\u0026rsquo;s logo visible brings trust. Make sure you do not use an icon already in use by one of the native modules, or without authorization from the owner of the logo/service.\nThe icon file must respect these requirements:\n It must be placed on the module\u0026rsquo;s main folder. PNG format, 32 by 32 pixels in size. Named logo.png.  There are many free icon libraries available on the web. Here are a few:\n Facow\u0026rsquo;s Farm Fresh Web Icons Danish Royalty Free   Installing the module Now that all basics are in place, reload the back office\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Module Catalog\u0026rdquo; page, in the \u0026ldquo;Front office features\u0026rdquo; section, you should find your module. Install it (or reset it if it is already installed).\nDuring the module\u0026rsquo;s installation, PrestaShop automatically creates a small config.xml file in the module\u0026rsquo;s folder, which stores the module\u0026rsquo;s information. You should be very careful when editing this file by hand.\nKeeping things secure Once your module is online, its files could be accessed by anyone from the Internet. Even if they cannot trigger anything but PHP errors, you might want to prevent this from happening.\nYou can achieve this by adding an index.php file at the root of any module folder you create. Here is a suggestion for what to put in the file.\n\u0026lt;?php header(\u0026#39;Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Last-Modified: \u0026#39; . gmdate(\u0026#39;D, d M Y H:i:s\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39; GMT\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0\u0026#39;, false); header(\u0026#39;Pragma: no-cache\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Location: ../\u0026#39;); exit; Further reading  "

	"content": "Tutorial: Creating your first module Before you start writing code for your PrestaShop module, we recommend reading PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Coding standards. Configuring your IDE hints or using automated tools can help you make sure you follow the project\u0026rsquo;s standards properly. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a simple first module; this will enable us to better describe its structure. We will name it \u0026ldquo;My module\u0026rdquo;.\nFirst, create the module\u0026rsquo;s folder, in PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s /modules folder. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it mymodule. This will be the module\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;technical\u0026rdquo; name.\nTechnical names can only accept lower case alphanumeric characters ([a-z0-9]). Although accepted, we strongly discourage using underscores because they don\u0026rsquo;t work with translation domains. This folder must contain the main file, a PHP file of the same name as the folder, which will handle most of the processing: mymodule.php.\nThat is enough for a very basic module. Obviously, more files and folders can be added later, if needed.\nThe constant test The main mymodule.php file must start with the following test:\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } This checks for the presence of an always-existing PrestaShop constant (its version number), and if it does not exist, it stops the module from loading. The sole purpose of this is to prevent malicious visitors to load this file directly.\nNote that, as required by PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Coding Standards (see above), we do not use a closing PHP tag.\nThe main class The main file must contain the module\u0026rsquo;s main class.\nIf you need to add more classes later, we suggest writing one single class per file. That main class must bear the same name as the module and its folder, in CamelCase. In our example: MyModule. Furthermore, that class must extend the Module class, in order to inherit all its methods and attributes.\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } class MyModule extends Module { } It can just as well extend any class derived from Module, for specific needs: PaymentModule, ModuleGridEngine, ModuleGraph, etc.\nAt this stage, if you place the module\u0026rsquo;s folder on the /modules folder, the module can already be seen in the \u0026ldquo;Module Catalog\u0026rdquo; page in the back office, in the \u0026ldquo;Other modules\u0026rdquo; section – albeit with no real name nor thumbnail.\nThe constructor method Now, let\u0026rsquo;s fill the class' code block with the essential constructor lines. Since the constructor is the first method to be called when the module is loaded by PrestaShop, this is the best place to set its details.\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } class MyModule extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;tab = \u0026#39;front_office_features\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;version = \u0026#39;1.0.0\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;author = \u0026#39;Firstname Lastname\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;need_instance = 0; $this-\u0026gt;ps_versions_compliancy = [ \u0026#39;min\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.6\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;max\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.7.99\u0026#39;, ]; $this-\u0026gt;bootstrap = true; parent::__construct(); $this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;confirmUninstall = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Are you sure you want to uninstall?\u0026#39;); if (!Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;)) { $this-\u0026gt;warning = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;No name provided\u0026#39;); } } } Let\u0026rsquo;s examine each line\u0026hellip;\n$this-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;tab = \u0026#39;front_office_features\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;version = \u0026#39;1.0\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;author = \u0026#39;Firstname Lastname\u0026#39;; This section assigns a handful of attributes to the class instance ($this):\n The name attribute serves as an internal identifier (technical name). The value MUST be the same as the module\u0026rsquo;s folder and main class file. Only lower case letters and numbers are accepted. The tab attribute contains the section that shall contain this module in the Module Manager section in the Back office (see list of available sections). We choose front_office_features because our module will mostly have an impact on the front-end. The version attribute contains the version number for the module, displayed in the modules list. We recommend following the Semantic Versioning specification. The author attribute, as you can imagine contains the author\u0026rsquo;s name. It is displayed as-is in the PrestaShop modules list.  Let\u0026rsquo;s continue with the next line in this block of code:\n$this-\u0026gt;need_instance = 0; $this-\u0026gt;ps_versions_compliancy = [ \u0026#39;min\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.6\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;max\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;1.7.99\u0026#39; ]; $this-\u0026gt;bootstrap = true; This section handles the relationship with the module and its environment (namely, PrestaShop):\n The need_instance attribute Indicates whether to load the module\u0026rsquo;s class when displaying the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; page in the back office. If set at 0, the module will not be loaded, and therefore will spend less resources to generate the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; page. If your module needs to display a warning message in the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; page, then you must set this attribute to 1. The ps_versions_compliancy attribute indicates which version of PrestaShop this module is compatible with. In the example above, we are defining the compatibility range between 1.6.0.0 and 1.7.99.0. The bootstrap attribute indicates that the module\u0026rsquo;s template files have been built with PrestaShop 1.6\u0026rsquo;s bootstrap tools in mind.  Next, we call the constructor method from the parent PHP class:\nparent::__construct(); This will trigger a lot of actions from PrestaShop that you do not need to know about at this point.\nThis method call must be placed after the definition of $this-\u0026gt;name variable and before any use of translation.\nThe next section deals with text strings, which are encapsulated in PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s translation method, l():\n$this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;confirmUninstall = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Are you sure you want to uninstall?\u0026#39;); if (!Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;)) { $this-\u0026gt;warning = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;No name provided.\u0026#39;); } These lines respectively assign:\n A name for the module, which will be displayed in the back office\u0026rsquo;s modules list. A description for the module, which will be displayed in the back office\u0026rsquo;s modules list. A message, asking the administrator if they really wants to uninstall the module. This is used in the uninstallation process. A warning that the module doesn\u0026rsquo;t have its MYMODULE_NAME database value set yet (this last point being specific to our example, as we will see later).  The constructor method is now complete. You are free to add more to it later if necessary, but this the bare minimum for a working module.\nNow go to your back office\u0026rsquo;s Module Catalog page (found at \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Module Catalog\u0026rdquo;) and search \u0026ldquo;mymodule\u0026rdquo;.

Here is a suggestion for what to put in the file.\n\u0026lt;?php header(\u0026#39;Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Last-Modified: \u0026#39; . gmdate(\u0026#39;D, d M Y H:i:s\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39; GMT\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0\u0026#39;, false); header(\u0026#39;Pragma: no-cache\u0026#39;); header(\u0026#39;Location: ../\u0026#39;); exit; Further reading  "

	"title": "Classic translation system",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Classic module translation system The classic translation system is a heritage from previous versions of PrestaShop and provides retrocompatibility with PrestaShop 1.6.\nDo you need this?\n If you plan on supporting only versions 1.7.6 and up, consider using the New translation system. Modern (symfony-based) modules and native modules only support the new system.   How it works This system works in two steps.\n1. Translation functions are used to display your module\u0026rsquo;s wordings in another language PrestaShop provides functions that allow PHP files and Smarty templates to display translated wordings. By leveraging the module\u0026rsquo;s dictionary files (generated in step 2), a module can use this feature to display a wording in another language during runtime.\n How wordings are translated at runtime   2. Creating dictionary files The Back Office\u0026rsquo;s Translation page (International \u0026gt; Translations \u0026gt; Modify Translations) is used to generate dictionary files. It extracts the module\u0026rsquo;s wordings by analyzing its source code, then displays a form that allows to translate them manually into any language installed in your shop. Once translated, this information is stored into dictionary files, which are placed inside the module\u0026rsquo;s translations directory. These dictionaries are used in step 1 to match the original wording with the translated one. In addition, dictionary files can be distributed with the module and be reused by other users.\n Translation workflow   Making your module translatable To make your module translatable, you need to adapt your module\u0026rsquo;s source code. Find any wording you want to make translatable, then wrap it using the appropriate method as explained below. Once wrapped, your wordings will be ready to be translated through the translation interface.\nBy default, wordings are displayed as originally written.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry if you don\u0026rsquo;t translate everything to all languages right away. Any wording left untranslated will be shown in its original language. Because of this, we suggest writing all your wordings in English, and then translating them to other languages.\n PHP files In PHP files, translation is performed using the module\u0026rsquo;s l() method.\nThis method accepts up to three parameters:\n $wording – The wording you want to translate. $specific – (Optional) The contextual file name. If not provided, it defaults to the current module\u0026rsquo;s technical name. Contextualization is explained below. $locale – (Optional) The language you want to translate to. If not provided, the user\u0026rsquo;s current language will be used.  Now let\u0026rsquo;s see some examples on how to use it.\nModule\u0026rsquo;s main class When translating wordings in the module\u0026rsquo;s main class, since it extends the Module class, you can simply call $this-\u0026gt;l().\n\u0026lt;?php class mymodule extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;); } } Module controllers ModuleAdminController and ModuleFrontController can access the module instance via the $this-\u0026gt;module property.\n\u0026lt;?php class MyModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function initContent() { $this-\u0026gt;title = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module title\u0026#39;); } } Other classes Other classes will need to retrieve the module\u0026rsquo;s instance somehow. We recommend passing it as a parameter in the constructor and storing it for later use.\n\u0026lt;?php class CustomModuleClass { private $module; public function __construct(Module $module) { $this-\u0026gt;module = $module; } public function foo() { $this-\u0026gt;text = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My text to translate\u0026#39;); } } If you really need to, you can also retrieve a new instance of your module using Module::getInstanceByName('mymodulename'). This should be avoided though, as it\u0026rsquo;s not a good practice.\nTemplates Wordings in Smarty .tpl files can be translated using the {l} function call, which Smarty will replace by the translation in the current language.\nThis function accepts three parameters:\n s – The wording to be translated. mod – Your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name. sprintf – Optional, it can be used to interpolate variables in your wording.  For instance, translating the string \u0026ldquo;Welcome to this page!\u0026rdquo; can be done like this:\n{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome to this page!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}In our sample module, the mymodule.tpl file\u0026hellip;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$base_dir}modules/mymodule/mymodule_page.php\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Click this link\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;mymodule_block_left\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;block\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Welcome!\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;block_content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello, {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} World {/if} ! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$my_module_link}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Click this link\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026hellip;becomes:\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$base_dir}modules/mymodule/mymodule_page.php\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;{l s=\u0026#39;Click this link\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Click me!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;mymodule_block_left\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;block\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;block_content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Hello,\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} {l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {/if} ! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$my_module_link}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;{l s=\u0026#39;Click this link\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Click me!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /Block mymodule --\u0026gt; As you can see, the basis of template file translation is to enclose them like this:\n{l s=\u0026#39;The string\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;name_of_the_module\u0026#39;} Notice how the mod parameter is always provided.

Isn\u0026rsquo;t there a better way to make this work?\nWe have two possible cases:\n \u0026quot;Hello \u0026quot; . $my_module_name . \u0026quot;!\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Hello World!\u0026quot;  We can start improving this by keeping the first case, then replacing the variable content to \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo; as needed:\n{if !isset($my_module_name) || !$my_module_name} {capture name=\u0026#39;my_module_tempvar\u0026#39;}{l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}{/capture} {assign var=\u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; value=$smarty.capture.my_module_tempvar} {/if} {l s=\u0026#39;Hello,\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {$my_module_name}! This is a start! In this example, when $my_module_name is not defined, we capture the value of translating \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo; and assign that value in $my_module_name. This way, we can simply display $my_module_name in any case.\nNow, when working in internationalization, it\u0026rsquo;s better not to make assumptions regarding spacing and positioning of variables. For example, in French, there should be a non-breaking space before the exclamation mark (!), but not in other languages. How can we handle this?\nIn PrestaShop, you can interpolate variables within your wordings using sprintf replacement markers, such as %s or %1$s. Using this feature, we could get rid of the explicit concatenation of \u0026ldquo;Hello, \u0026ldquo;, \u0026ldquo;$my_module_name\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo;, and let it depend on the translated wording:\n{if !isset($my_module_name) || !$my_module_name} {capture name=\u0026#39;my_module_tempvar\u0026#39;}{l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}{/capture} {assign var=\u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; value=$smarty.capture.my_module_tempvar} {/if} {l s=\u0026#39;Hello %s!\u0026#39; sprintf=[$my_module_name] mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} This way, since the variable replacement will happen after the wording is translated, we can have a wording in English like Hello %s!, being translated as Bonjour %s ! in French.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no fixed \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; format for placeholders.\nYou can use sprintf markers like %s and %d, or replacement tokens like [foo] and %bar%. If you choose to use tokens, just remember to provide an associative array:\nsprintf=[\u0026#39;[foo]\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;some replacement, \u0026#39;%bar%\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;something else\u0026#39;]  Interpolating HTML You may need to add HTML content in your translated string. Writing it directly in the string (original or translated) won\u0026rsquo;t work, as the special characters would be escaped to avoid XSS security issues.\nInstead, you should use placeholders and replace them with HTML code.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example with a link in a string, which can be tricky to do. The first solution that comes to mind would be to concatenate the translated strings with raw HTML code. But as we explained before, this solution is not recommended, because the words order could be different depending on the translation language.\n{l s=\u0026#39;If you want a category to appear in the menu of your shop, go to [modules-link]Modules \u0026gt; Modules \u0026amp; Services \u0026gt; Installed modules.[/modules-link] Then, configure your menu module.\u0026#39; sprintf=[ \u0026#39;[modules-link]\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026#34;{$link-\u0026gt;getAdminLink(\u0026#39;AdminModules\u0026#39;)}\\\u0026#34; target=\\\u0026#34;_blank\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;[/modules-link]\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026#39; ] mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39; }Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the resulting string:\nIf you want a category to appear in the menu of your shop, go to \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;(...)\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Modules \u0026amp;gt; Modules \u0026amp;amp; Services \u0026amp;gt; Installed modules.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Then, configure your menu module. Make sure to keep [modules-link] and [/modules-link] when translating the wording to other languages.\nContextualization Sometimes the same wording would be translated differently when used in two different contexts. To allow translators to pick the best translation for each context, module developers can choose to contextualize wordings by specifying the file where it\u0026rsquo;s used. When context is provided, translators can choose a different translation for each context.\nAlthough contextualization is optional, we strongly suggest to contextualize all your wordings.\nContextualization works differently in the Core, see Core Translation. Contextualize translations in PHP files Context is defined by setting the second parameter of l() to something of your choosing. By convention, we suggest using the name of the php file it\u0026rsquo;s located in, like this:\n\u0026lt;?php // in SomeFile.php  $module-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;somefile\u0026#39;);  When no context is provided, PrestaShop automatically sets it to your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name Contextualize translations in template files Good news! Contextualization is performed automatically in template files, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything.\nCreating translation dictionary files Translation dictionary files can be created inside the PrestaShop Back Office:\n Go to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page under the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; menu, In the \u0026ldquo;Modify translations\u0026rdquo; section, find the \u0026ldquo;Type of translation\u0026rdquo; drop-down and select \u0026ldquo;Installed modules translations\u0026rdquo;, Choose the module you want to translate. Choose the language you want to translate the module into. The destination language must already be installed to enable translation in it. Click the \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo; button.  You will be presented with a page that displays all the wordings for the selected module, grouped by translation context. Groups where all wordings have already been translated appear collapsed, whereas groups where at least one string is missing appear expanded. In order to translate your module, simply fill out the empty fields.\nOnce all strings for your module are correctly translated, click on either the \u0026ldquo;Save and stay\u0026rdquo; button or the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom of the list.\nPrestaShop then saves the translations in a file named using the \u0026lt;language_code\u0026gt;.php format and located in you module\u0026rsquo;s translations directory (for instance, /mymodule/translations/fr.php).\nThe translation file looks like this:\n\u0026lt;?php // fr.php  global $_MODULE; $_MODULE = array(); $_MODULE[\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{mymodule}prestashop\u0026gt;mymodule_2ddddc2a736e4128ce1cdfd22b041e7f\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;Mon module\u0026#39;; $_MODULE[\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{mymodule}prestashop\u0026gt;mymodule_d6968577f69f08c93c209bd8b6b3d4d5\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;Description du module.\u0026#39;; $_MODULE[\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{mymodule}prestashop\u0026gt;mymodule_533937acf0e84c92e787614bbb16a7a0\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;Êtes-vous certain de vouloir désinstaller ce module ?

It is meant to be edited through the PrestaShop translation interface. Editing a dictionary file manually If for any reason you need to edit your dictionary file manually or create it from scratch, here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nDictionary files are essentially a list of key-values that match a representation of the original wording as it appears in the code, and its translation to a given language. The key stays the same across all translation dictionary files for a given module.\nTranslation keys have a tricky syntax, which is constructed as follows:\n\u0026lt;?php $translationKey = strtolower(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{\u0026#39; . $moduleName . \u0026#39;}prestashop\u0026gt;\u0026#39; . $sourceFile) . \u0026#39;_\u0026#39; . $md5; As you can see, there are three parameters:\n  $moduleName – Your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name, in lower case.\n  $sourceFile – Name of the file where the wording is used, according to the following rules:\n If the translation is performed in PHP code via call to $this-\u0026gt;l(...) function:  The second argument to that function, if provided. Your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name, in lowercase, if not provided.   If the translation is performed in a .tpl file via {l} smarty tag:  The file name, in lowercase, without the extension removed (eg. foo.tpl → foo)      $md5 – MD5 hash of the original wording you intend to translate.\n  If you are manually building a translation file to use with the New translation system, keep in mind the Backward compatibility constraints. Limitations and caveats Making your wordings appear in the translation interface The translation interface relies on code analysis to \u0026ldquo;discover\u0026rdquo; wordings for translation. Therefore, when declaring wordings in your code, some care is needed in order to make sure they can be discovered.\n  The translation interface only detects wordings used through the l() function and the {l} Smarty tag. Therefore, they must be declared in a PHP or TPL file. They will be detected regardless of whether that code is actually used in runtime or not.\n  Always use literal values, not variables, with the l() function and the {l} Smarty tag. Although variables are interpreted at runtime, they won\u0026rsquo;t be understood by the code analyzer, which only supports literals. Passing variables to these methods will prevent those wordings from appearing in the translation interface.\n  Example:\n\u0026lt;?php // literal values will work $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;somecontext\u0026#39;); // dynamic content can be injected using placeholders \u0026amp; sprintf sprintf( $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some wording with %s\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;somecontext\u0026#39;), $dynamicContent ); // this won\u0026#39;t work, the interpreter will ignore variables $wording = \u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;; $context = \u0026#39;somecontext\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;l($wording, $context); // this will yield unexpected results $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some \u0026#39;. $var . \u0026#39; wording\u0026#39;); // dynamic behavior, like aliasing the l() function, won\u0026#39;t work well either public function translate($wording) { $this-\u0026gt;l($wording); } Language codes The classic translation system identifies languages using a two-letter code referred to as \u0026ldquo;Language code\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ISO code\u0026rdquo;, based on the ISO-619-1 standard (see an unofficial list here).\nSince this standard does not include regional language variants, like British English, Canadian French or Swiss German for example, PrestaShop supports them through nonstandard language codes (gb, qc and dh respectively).\nThis historical choice is subject to debate because of the interoperability issues it raises. In order to fully address them, a future major version of PrestaShop will switch completely to IETF language tags for language identification. PrestaShop already uses them for some purposes.\nIn the meantime, refer to this list for the equivalences between language codes and IETF language tags: Legacy to standard locales.\n"

	"content": "Classic module translation system The classic translation system is a heritage from previous versions of PrestaShop and provides retrocompatibility with PrestaShop 1.6.\nDo you need this?\n If you plan on supporting only versions 1.7.6 and up, consider using the New translation system. Modern (symfony-based) modules and native modules only support the new system.   How it works This system works in two steps.\n1. Translation functions are used to display your module\u0026rsquo;s wordings in another language PrestaShop provides functions that allow PHP files and Smarty templates to display translated wordings. By leveraging the module\u0026rsquo;s dictionary files (generated in step 2), a module can use this feature to display a wording in another language during runtime.\n How wordings are translated at runtime   2. Creating dictionary files The Back Office\u0026rsquo;s Translation page (International \u0026gt; Translations \u0026gt; Modify Translations) is used to generate dictionary files. It extracts the module\u0026rsquo;s wordings by analyzing its source code, then displays a form that allows to translate them manually into any language installed in your shop. Once translated, this information is stored into dictionary files, which are placed inside the module\u0026rsquo;s translations directory. These dictionaries are used in step 1 to match the original wording with the translated one. In addition, dictionary files can be distributed with the module and be reused by other users.\n Translation workflow   Making your module translatable To make your module translatable, you need to adapt your module\u0026rsquo;s source code. Find any wording you want to make translatable, then wrap it using the appropriate method as explained below. Once wrapped, your wordings will be ready to be translated through the translation interface.\nBy default, wordings are displayed as originally written.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry if you don\u0026rsquo;t translate everything to all languages right away. Any wording left untranslated will be shown in its original language. Because of this, we suggest writing all your wordings in English, and then translating them to other languages.\n PHP files In PHP files, translation is performed using the module\u0026rsquo;s l() method.\nThis method accepts up to three parameters:\n $wording – The wording you want to translate. $specific – (Optional) The contextual file name. If not provided, it defaults to the current module\u0026rsquo;s technical name. Contextualization is explained below. $locale – (Optional) The language you want to translate to. If not provided, the user\u0026rsquo;s current language will be used.  Now let\u0026rsquo;s see some examples on how to use it.\nModule\u0026rsquo;s main class When translating wordings in the module\u0026rsquo;s main class, since it extends the Module class, you can simply call $this-\u0026gt;l().\n\u0026lt;?php class mymodule extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;displayName = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;description = $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Description of my module.\u0026#39;); } } Module controllers ModuleAdminController and ModuleFrontController can access the module instance via the $this-\u0026gt;module property.\n\u0026lt;?php class MyModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function initContent() { $this-\u0026gt;title = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My module title\u0026#39;); } } Other classes Other classes will need to retrieve the module\u0026rsquo;s instance somehow. We recommend passing it as a parameter in the constructor and storing it for later use.\n\u0026lt;?php class CustomModuleClass { private $module; public function __construct(Module $module) { $this-\u0026gt;module = $module; } public function foo() { $this-\u0026gt;text = $this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;My text to translate\u0026#39;); } } If you really need to, you can also retrieve a new instance of your module using Module::getInstanceByName('mymodulename'). This should be avoided though, as it\u0026rsquo;s not a good practice.\nTemplates Wordings in Smarty .tpl files can be translated using the {l} function call, which Smarty will replace by the translation in the current language.\nThis function accepts three parameters:\n s – The wording to be translated. mod – Your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name. sprintf – Optional, it can be used to interpolate variables in your wording.  For instance, translating the string \u0026ldquo;Welcome to this page!\u0026rdquo; can be done like this:\n{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome to this page!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}In our sample module, the mymodule.tpl file\u0026hellip;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$base_dir}modules/mymodule/mymodule_page.php\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Click this link\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;mymodule_block_left\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;block\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Welcome!\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;block_content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello, {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} World {/if} ! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$my_module_link}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Click this link\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026hellip;becomes:\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$base_dir}modules/mymodule/mymodule_page.php\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;{l s=\u0026#39;Click this link\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Click me!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;mymodule_block_left\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;block\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;block_content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Hello,\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} {l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {/if} ! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$my_module_link}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;{l s=\u0026#39;Click this link\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Click me!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /Block mymodule --\u0026gt; As you can see, the basis of template file translation is to enclose them like this:\n{l s=\u0026#39;The string\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;name_of_the_module\u0026#39;} Notice how the mod parameter is always provided. This parameter is mandatory for module translation in templates. It is used by PrestaShop to assert which module the string belongs to.\nVariable interpolation The changes in mymodule.tpl\u0026rsquo;s link and title texts are straightforward to understand. But consider this block:\n{l s=\u0026#39;Hello,\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} {l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {/if} ! Isn\u0026rsquo;t there a better way to make this work?\nWe have two possible cases:\n \u0026quot;Hello \u0026quot; . $my_module_name . \u0026quot;!\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Hello World!\u0026quot;  We can start improving this by keeping the first case, then replacing the variable content to \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo; as needed:\n{if !isset($my_module_name) || !$my_module_name} {capture name=\u0026#39;my_module_tempvar\u0026#39;}{l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}{/capture} {assign var=\u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; value=$smarty.capture.my_module_tempvar} {/if} {l s=\u0026#39;Hello,\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} {$my_module_name}! This is a start! In this example, when $my_module_name is not defined, we capture the value of translating \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo; and assign that value in $my_module_name. This way, we can simply display $my_module_name in any case.\nNow, when working in internationalization, it\u0026rsquo;s better not to make assumptions regarding spacing and positioning of variables. For example, in French, there should be a non-breaking space before the exclamation mark (!), but not in other languages. How can we handle this?\nIn PrestaShop, you can interpolate variables within your wordings using sprintf replacement markers, such as %s or %1$s. Using this feature, we could get rid of the explicit concatenation of \u0026ldquo;Hello, \u0026ldquo;, \u0026ldquo;$my_module_name\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;!\u0026rdquo;, and let it depend on the translated wording:\n{if !isset($my_module_name) || !$my_module_name} {capture name=\u0026#39;my_module_tempvar\u0026#39;}{l s=\u0026#39;World\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}{/capture} {assign var=\u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; value=$smarty.capture.my_module_tempvar} {/if} {l s=\u0026#39;Hello %s!\u0026#39; sprintf=[$my_module_name] mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;} This way, since the variable replacement will happen after the wording is translated, we can have a wording in English like Hello %s!, being translated as Bonjour %s ! in French.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no fixed \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; format for placeholders.\nYou can use sprintf markers like %s and %d, or replacement tokens like [foo] and %bar%. If you choose to use tokens, just remember to provide an associative array:\nsprintf=[\u0026#39;[foo]\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;some replacement, \u0026#39;%bar%\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;something else\u0026#39;]  Interpolating HTML You may need to add HTML content in your translated string. Writing it directly in the string (original or translated) won\u0026rsquo;t work, as the special characters would be escaped to avoid XSS security issues.\nInstead, you should use placeholders and replace them with HTML code.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example with a link in a string, which can be tricky to do. The first solution that comes to mind would be to concatenate the translated strings with raw HTML code. But as we explained before, this solution is not recommended, because the words order could be different depending on the translation language.\n{l s=\u0026#39;If you want a category to appear in the menu of your shop, go to [modules-link]Modules \u0026gt; Modules \u0026amp; Services \u0026gt; Installed modules.[/modules-link] Then, configure your menu module.\u0026#39; sprintf=[ \u0026#39;[modules-link]\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026#34;{$link-\u0026gt;getAdminLink(\u0026#39;AdminModules\u0026#39;)}\\\u0026#34; target=\\\u0026#34;_blank\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;[/modules-link]\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026#39; ] mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39; }Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the resulting string:\nIf you want a category to appear in the menu of your shop, go to \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;(...)\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Modules \u0026amp;gt; Modules \u0026amp;amp; Services \u0026amp;gt; Installed modules.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Then, configure your menu module. Make sure to keep [modules-link] and [/modules-link] when translating the wording to other languages.\nContextualization Sometimes the same wording would be translated differently when used in two different contexts. To allow translators to pick the best translation for each context, module developers can choose to contextualize wordings by specifying the file where it\u0026rsquo;s used. When context is provided, translators can choose a different translation for each context.\nAlthough contextualization is optional, we strongly suggest to contextualize all your wordings.\nContextualization works differently in the Core, see Core Translation. Contextualize translations in PHP files Context is defined by setting the second parameter of l() to something of your choosing. By convention, we suggest using the name of the php file it\u0026rsquo;s located in, like this:\n\u0026lt;?php // in SomeFile.php  $module-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;somefile\u0026#39;);  When no context is provided, PrestaShop automatically sets it to your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name Contextualize translations in template files Good news! Contextualization is performed automatically in template files, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything.\nCreating translation dictionary files Translation dictionary files can be created inside the PrestaShop Back Office:\n Go to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page under the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; menu, In the \u0026ldquo;Modify translations\u0026rdquo; section, find the \u0026ldquo;Type of translation\u0026rdquo; drop-down and select \u0026ldquo;Installed modules translations\u0026rdquo;, Choose the module you want to translate. Choose the language you want to translate the module into. The destination language must already be installed to enable translation in it. Click the \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo; button.  You will be presented with a page that displays all the wordings for the selected module, grouped by translation context. Groups where all wordings have already been translated appear collapsed, whereas groups where at least one string is missing appear expanded. In order to translate your module, simply fill out the empty fields.\nOnce all strings for your module are correctly translated, click on either the \u0026ldquo;Save and stay\u0026rdquo; button or the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom of the list.\nPrestaShop then saves the translations in a file named using the \u0026lt;language_code\u0026gt;.php format and located in you module\u0026rsquo;s translations directory (for instance, /mymodule/translations/fr.php).\nThe translation file looks like this:\n\u0026lt;?php // fr.php  global $_MODULE; $_MODULE = array(); $_MODULE[\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{mymodule}prestashop\u0026gt;mymodule_2ddddc2a736e4128ce1cdfd22b041e7f\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;Mon module\u0026#39;; $_MODULE[\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{mymodule}prestashop\u0026gt;mymodule_d6968577f69f08c93c209bd8b6b3d4d5\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;Description du module.\u0026#39;; $_MODULE[\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{mymodule}prestashop\u0026gt;mymodule_533937acf0e84c92e787614bbb16a7a0\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;Êtes-vous certain de vouloir désinstaller ce module ?

It is meant to be edited through the PrestaShop translation interface. Editing a dictionary file manually If for any reason you need to edit your dictionary file manually or create it from scratch, here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nDictionary files are essentially a list of key-values that match a representation of the original wording as it appears in the code, and its translation to a given language. The key stays the same across all translation dictionary files for a given module.\nTranslation keys have a tricky syntax, which is constructed as follows:\n\u0026lt;?php $translationKey = strtolower(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;{\u0026#39; . $moduleName . \u0026#39;}prestashop\u0026gt;\u0026#39; . $sourceFile) . \u0026#39;_\u0026#39; . $md5; As you can see, there are three parameters:\n  $moduleName – Your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name, in lower case.\n  $sourceFile – Name of the file where the wording is used, according to the following rules:\n If the translation is performed in PHP code via call to $this-\u0026gt;l(...) function:  The second argument to that function, if provided. Your module\u0026rsquo;s technical name, in lowercase, if not provided.   If the translation is performed in a .tpl file via {l} smarty tag:  The file name, in lowercase, without the extension removed (eg. foo.tpl → foo)      $md5 – MD5 hash of the original wording you intend to translate.\n  If you are manually building a translation file to use with the New translation system, keep in mind the Backward compatibility constraints. Limitations and caveats Making your wordings appear in the translation interface The translation interface relies on code analysis to \u0026ldquo;discover\u0026rdquo; wordings for translation. Therefore, when declaring wordings in your code, some care is needed in order to make sure they can be discovered.\n  The translation interface only detects wordings used through the l() function and the {l} Smarty tag. Therefore, they must be declared in a PHP or TPL file. They will be detected regardless of whether that code is actually used in runtime or not.\n  Always use literal values, not variables, with the l() function and the {l} Smarty tag. Although variables are interpreted at runtime, they won\u0026rsquo;t be understood by the code analyzer, which only supports literals. Passing variables to these methods will prevent those wordings from appearing in the translation interface.\n  Example:\n\u0026lt;?php // literal values will work $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;somecontext\u0026#39;); // dynamic content can be injected using placeholders \u0026amp; sprintf sprintf( $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some wording with %s\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;somecontext\u0026#39;), $dynamicContent ); // this won\u0026#39;t work, the interpreter will ignore variables $wording = \u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;; $context = \u0026#39;somecontext\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;l($wording, $context); // this will yield unexpected results $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Some \u0026#39;. $var . \u0026#39; wording\u0026#39;); // dynamic behavior, like aliasing the l() function, won\u0026#39;t work well either public function translate($wording) { $this-\u0026gt;l($wording); } Language codes The classic translation system identifies languages using a two-letter code referred to as \u0026ldquo;Language code\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ISO code\u0026rdquo;, based on the ISO-619-1 standard (see an unofficial list here).\nSince this standard does not include regional language variants, like British English, Canadian French or Swiss German for example, PrestaShop supports them through nonstandard language codes (gb, qc and dh respectively).\nThis historical choice is subject to debate because of the interoperability issues it raises. In order to fully address them, a future major version of PrestaShop will switch completely to IETF language tags for language identification. PrestaShop already uses them for some purposes.\nIn the meantime, refer to this list for the equivalences between language codes and IETF language tags: Legacy to standard locales.\n"

	"content": "Front controllers These class are accessible from the front-office and add features to the customers.\nCreating a front controller In order to have a front controller read by PrestaShop, these 3 rules have to be followed:\n it is stored in the subfolder controllers/front/ of the module. in CamelCase, the class name follows this format: \u0026lt;ModuleClassName\u0026gt;\u0026lt;FileName\u0026gt;ModuleFrontController. it extends the class ModuleFrontController.  Minimum controller example Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want a controller responsible of payments validation in our module cheque.\nWe create a file /modules/cheque/controllers/front/validation.php and its class:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * \u0026lt;ModuleClassName\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; Cheque * \u0026lt;FileName\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; validation.php * Format expected: \u0026lt;ModuleClassName\u0026gt;\u0026lt;FileName\u0026gt;ModuleFrontController */ class ChequeValidationModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { } That\u0026rsquo;s all, methods added to the class will be taken in account by PrestaShop automatically.\nAvailable properties The controllers added in a module extend ModuleFrontController, itself extending FrontController \u0026amp; Controller. They provide access to the environment in which they run.\n $this-\u0026gt;module is the instance of the module responsible of the controller. $this-\u0026gt;context delivers the result of Context::getContext().  Other existing properties may be useful and can be discovered by looking at the parent classes content (by following links above) or with dump($this).\nAdding methods to the controller There are basically two kinds of HTTP calls possible for a controller:\n Calls with GET, used to only retrieve data, Calls with POST, used as soon as some data is modified on the shop.  Depending of the request made to the controller, a different method will be called by the core.\nDisplay content (GET) Handling GET requests can be done by implementing the method initContent() in the front controller.

	"content": "Front controllers These class are accessible from the front-office and add features to the customers.\nCreating a front controller In order to have a front controller read by PrestaShop, these 3 rules have to be followed:\n it is stored in the subfolder controllers/front/ of the module. in CamelCase, the class name follows this format: \u0026lt;ModuleClassName\u0026gt;\u0026lt;FileName\u0026gt;ModuleFrontController. it extends the class ModuleFrontController.  Minimum controller example Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want a controller responsible of payments validation in our module cheque.\nWe create a file /modules/cheque/controllers/front/validation.php and its class:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * \u0026lt;ModuleClassName\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; Cheque * \u0026lt;FileName\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; validation.php * Format expected: \u0026lt;ModuleClassName\u0026gt;\u0026lt;FileName\u0026gt;ModuleFrontController */ class ChequeValidationModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { } That\u0026rsquo;s all, methods added to the class will be taken in account by PrestaShop automatically.\nAvailable properties The controllers added in a module extend ModuleFrontController, itself extending FrontController \u0026amp; Controller. They provide access to the environment in which they run.\n $this-\u0026gt;module is the instance of the module responsible of the controller. $this-\u0026gt;context delivers the result of Context::getContext().  Other existing properties may be useful and can be discovered by looking at the parent classes content (by following links above) or with dump($this).\nAdding methods to the controller There are basically two kinds of HTTP calls possible for a controller:\n Calls with GET, used to only retrieve data, Calls with POST, used as soon as some data is modified on the shop.  Depending of the request made to the controller, a different method will be called by the core.\nDisplay content (GET) Handling GET requests can be done by implementing the method initContent() in the front controller.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Hooks Hooks are a way to associate your code to some specific PrestaShop events.\nMost of the time, they are used to insert content in a page. The place it will be added (header, footer, left or right column \u0026hellip;) will depend on the hook you choose.\nHooks can also be used to perform specific actions under certain circumstances (i.e. sending an e-mail to the client on an order creation).\nNaming scheme Hook names are prefixed with \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;display\u0026rdquo;. This prefix indicates if a hook is triggered by an event or if it\u0026rsquo;s used to display content:\n action\u0026lt;Something\u0026gt; Triggered by specific events that take place in PrestaShop. display\u0026lt;Something\u0026gt; Result in something being displayed, either in the front-end or the back-end.  Using hooks Registration Every hook you want to use must be registered first. This is usually done during the installation of your module, by calling the method Module::registerHook($hookName).\n\u0026lt;?php public function install() { // [...]  $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayHeader\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayFooter\u0026#39;); // [...] } If you do not know where you can register, a list of available hooks is available.\nExecution For each registered hook, you must create a non-static public method, starting with the \u0026ldquo;hook\u0026rdquo; keyword followed by the name of the hook you want to use (starting with either \u0026ldquo;display\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo;).\nThis method receives one (and only one) argument: an array of the contextual information sent to the hook.\n\u0026lt;?php public function hookDisplayHeader(array $params) { // Your code. } public function hookDisplayFooter(array $params) { // Your code. } public function hookActionOtherHook(array $params) { // Your code. } Remember, in order for a module to respond to a hook call, it must be registered within PrestaShop.\nTriggering a hook In a controller It is easy to call a hook from within a controller: you simply have to use its name with the Hook::exec($hook_name, $hook_args = array()) method. Some parameters can be sent as well.\nFor instance:\n\u0026lt;?php $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;assign( \u0026#39;HOOK_LEFT_COLUMN\u0026#39;, Hook::exec(\u0026#39;displayLeftColumn\u0026#39;) ); In a theme It is easy to call a hook from within a template file (.tpl): you simply have to use its name with the hook function. You can add the name of a module that you want the hook execute.\nBasic call of a hook:\n{hook h=\u0026#39;displayLeftColumn\u0026#39;} Call of a hook for a specific module:\n{hook h=\u0026#39;displayLeftColumn\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;blockcart\u0026#39;} Going further: Creating your own hook You can create new PrestaShop hooks by adding a new record in the Hook table. This can be done with the Hook class, which inherit ObjectModel features:\n\u0026lt;?php $hook = new Hook(); $hook-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#39;displayAtSpecificPlace\u0026#39;; $hook-\u0026gt;title = \u0026#39;The name of your hook\u0026#39;; $hook-\u0026gt;description = \u0026#39;This is a custom hook!\u0026#39;; $hook-\u0026gt;position = 1; $hook-\u0026gt;add(); // return true on success  You can check if hook exists before this with Hook::getIdByName(\u0026#39;hook_name\u0026#39;) \u0026hellip;but PrestaShop enables you to do it the easy way:\n\u0026lt;?php $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayAtSpecificPlace\u0026#39;); If the hook \u0026ldquo;displayAtSpecificPlace\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, PrestaShop will create it for you but be carefull : this will also plug the current module to the hook.\n"

	"content": "Hooks Hooks are a way to associate your code to some specific PrestaShop events.\nMost of the time, they are used to insert content in a page. The place it will be added (header, footer, left or right column \u0026hellip;) will depend on the hook you choose.\nHooks can also be used to perform specific actions under certain circumstances (i.e. sending an e-mail to the client on an order creation).\nNaming scheme Hook names are prefixed with \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;display\u0026rdquo;. This prefix indicates if a hook is triggered by an event or if it\u0026rsquo;s used to display content:\n action\u0026lt;Something\u0026gt; Triggered by specific events that take place in PrestaShop. display\u0026lt;Something\u0026gt; Result in something being displayed, either in the front-end or the back-end.  Using hooks Registration Every hook you want to use must be registered first. This is usually done during the installation of your module, by calling the method Module::registerHook($hookName).\n\u0026lt;?php public function install() { // [...]  $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayHeader\u0026#39;); $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayFooter\u0026#39;); // [...] } If you do not know where you can register, a list of available hooks is available.\nExecution For each registered hook, you must create a non-static public method, starting with the \u0026ldquo;hook\u0026rdquo; keyword followed by the name of the hook you want to use (starting with either \u0026ldquo;display\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo;).\nThis method receives one (and only one) argument: an array of the contextual information sent to the hook.\n\u0026lt;?php public function hookDisplayHeader(array $params) { // Your code. } public function hookDisplayFooter(array $params) { // Your code. } public function hookActionOtherHook(array $params) { // Your code. } Remember, in order for a module to respond to a hook call, it must be registered within PrestaShop.\nTriggering a hook In a controller It is easy to call a hook from within a controller: you simply have to use its name with the Hook::exec($hook_name, $hook_args = array()) method. Some parameters can be sent as well.\nFor instance:\n\u0026lt;?php $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;assign( \u0026#39;HOOK_LEFT_COLUMN\u0026#39;, Hook::exec(\u0026#39;displayLeftColumn\u0026#39;) ); In a theme It is easy to call a hook from within a template file (.tpl): you simply have to use its name with the hook function. You can add the name of a module that you want the hook execute.\nBasic call of a hook:\n{hook h=\u0026#39;displayLeftColumn\u0026#39;} Call of a hook for a specific module:\n{hook h=\u0026#39;displayLeftColumn\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;blockcart\u0026#39;} Going further: Creating your own hook You can create new PrestaShop hooks by adding a new record in the Hook table.

When a Core maintainer sees a pull request, they will review it and decide whether it should be accepted, if it needs changes, or if it cannot be accepted.\nThe review process is quite thorough in order to make sure that PrestaShop codebase gets better with each contribution. Here is all the things looked for in a Pull Request, when reviewing it:\n The start is checking that the code is correct. This means both from a behavior point of view as well as from a technical point of view. This is simply an assessment of the quality of the Pull Request code, just like it happens in a lot of software teams. The Core maintainers check the code works as intended, it uses the right functions, it handles expectable edge-cases, has no obvious vulnerabilities, scales well, etc. The Core maintainers also keep in mind that PrestaShop is a CMS and consequently must provide all the necessary extension points to allow developers to customize or extend its behavior. The Core maintainers also assess the readability of the code. There is a statement that says \u0026ldquo;when a code file is opened by a developer, 9 times out of 10 it will only to be read, not to be modified\u0026rdquo;. Because PrestaShop is a huge and complex codebase and because it has so many people reading through it, it is very important that its code is made as readable as possible. This is obtained by adding comments, carefully choosing function and variable names, and building an architecture that makes sense so it is easy to grasp and navigate for people who have never worked on it before. The Core maintainers also check that best practices are implemented into the Pull Request, be it standard conventions or practices like PSR or best security recommandations like the ones from OWASP. When people use PrestaShop to build a shop, it is likely that they will follow the practices they see implemented in the Core, so the aim is to think of the code merged as an example that people will use. PrestaShop has grown huge over the years, both as a codebase and as a software. There are hundreds of features built in the software, and some are more commonly used than others. Some contributions sometimes need to be reworked because they did not take into account one of the less popular features of the software, or are not compatible with them. Common examples are the multi-store mode or the RTL (Right-To-Left) mode, two features that adress very specific needs and that many developers are not aware of. PrestaShop follows SemVer. This means that The Core maintainers strive not to introduce breaking compatibility changes when releasing minor and patch versions. Therefore, each Pull Request must not introduce such changes. The Core maintainers also have a vision of what PrestaShop should evolve to in order to follow the new trends in the software world. Although a big codebase like PrestaShop evolves slowly, the future architecture and features to come are kept in mind, and the Core maintainers check whether the Pull Request is following this direction. For example today PrestaShop relies heavily on jQuery for its frontend features, and Vue.js is slowly starting to be used in the project. So if tomorrow a Pull Request that is using React.js is submitted, it might be refused in order to keep a consistency in the technology stack used for the project.  Some Pull Requests are very hard to review because they are related to a complex topic, a complex area of the code or have a huge global impact on the software that is very hard to estimate and assess.

	"description": "",
	"content": "How to contribute and create UI tests Architecture Page Object Model (also called Page Object Pattern) is a way to organize your code in a test framework. It encourages you to separate your test logic from your page manipulation logic.\nOur team uses POM as an architecture to organize the code: on one side we have our page logic, and on the other side we have our test logic.\nThe goal is to write your test code once, and only change the page logic when someone updates the application.\nBoth are described in the following paragraphs.\nPages Name The name of the class must be simple and linked to the page in the shop. You should be able to find the corresponding page in the application using the folder hierarchy, and the class name.\nThe convention for naming the file itself is different: the main page name is always index.js, while other pages should always have a relevant name.\nExample:\nFor BO products pages located at pages/catalog/products/, we use 2 classes:\n index.js for the products listing page (main page) add.js for the add/edit product page  Inheritance We heavily use inheritance in the pages to make sure all our generic methods are available from everywhere, and you don’t need to instantiate separate objects.\nThere is a main mother class, called CommonPage, located at the root of the pages folder.\nWe have another level of inheritance in each root folder (BO and FO) through the classes BOmainPage.js and FOMainPage.js. Of course, CommonPage is not meant to be instantiated (it’s kind of an abstract class) !\nWhen you create new page classes, make sure to make them inherit from their respective XXMainPage to be sure to be able to use both generic methods and specific methods.\nExamples:\n Install page (which is independent) extends from CommonPage Brands page (which is part of the BO) extends from BOBasePage Checkout page (which is part of the FO) extends from FOBasePage  Methods Methods inside a page class must be properly named about their primary function. Remember to KISS ! You should be able to understand what a method does just by looking at its name.\nMethods inside a page class CANNOT USE the expect keyword or any kind of asserting function, since their sole purpose is to interact with the page they’re linked with. They don’t validate anything per se, they just expose functionalities. To validate a behavior in your test logic, your methods can return booleans, integers (number of lines, elements, etc), strings, objects\u0026hellip; It’s up to you.\nExample:\n/** * Get order status * @param page * @return {Promise\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;} */ async getOrderStatus(page) { return this.getTextContent(page, `${this.orderStatusesSelect}option[selected=\u0026#39;selected\u0026#39;]`, false); } This method returns the text content of the selected option in the Status select element in the Orders page.\nSelectors Selectors are used on every page and are stored as attributes of the class. They should be named following this convention: nameType in camelCase, with name being the distinctive information about the element and type being its type (see below).\nFor example, a button used to submit the main form in the order page should be named: submitMainFormButton.\nTypes Each selector must belong to a certain type. Here is a non-exhaustive list:\n Button, link, block, image, icon, text, modal, other HTML elements\u0026hellip; Table, table-header, row, column, other table elements\u0026hellip; Form, input, select, radio, checkbox, other forms inputs\u0026hellip;  Tests Campaigns We currently have 2 campaigns implemented:\n Sanity: its purpose is to validate a Pull Request. Executed on Travis CI, this campaign must fully pass before merging the PR (one failed test blocks the merge). It consists of a few tests of the core features of PrestaShop: shop installation, orders/products pages in BO, and catalog/cart/checkout process in FO. Functional: it is the biggest and most important campaign. Its purpose is to validate that every feature of PrestaShop works, by testing them one by one. It goes on every page and tests whatever it can: table (filtering, ordering, quick edits, etc), CRUD items (orders, customers, products…), setting changes, etc.  We plan on implementing 2 more campaigns:\n End to end: its purpose is to check that popular user paths are working as intended. It will walk through the application and mimic a real user working on their daily routines as a merchant: checking products, generating invoices, creating a customer account, and an order, adding a special voucher for a specific user, etc. The selected user paths will be chosen by the Product Team. Thanks to their merchants and agencies interviews, they have a pretty good idea of what merchants do every day and how they use the software. Regression: a test campaign tailored to only target major and critical issues in the few last versions of PrestaShop, to make sure they don’t come back (hence the name).  Mocha and Mochawesome Mocha is our test runner (a framework that reads our test code and runs it). We use it in coordination with Mochawesome, a plugin for Mocha. Mochawesome produces a full JSON report in addition to a beautiful HTML report (which we don’t really use). The JSON file is sent to our Nightly Board, it is then inserted into the database to let visitors browse reports and visualize statistics.\nLambda function in describes Using lambda functions in mocha is discouraged. They bind this to the scope of the lambda function, making it impossible to use internal Mocha methods and objects. Since we may use the Mocha context to store some variables in the future, we strongly advise you to use the normal function() syntax.\nUtils The utils directory contain files that are necessary to run tests.\nGlobals This file contains all global variables that can be used in test files, pages and common tests.\nThe description of each variable in this file can be found in README.md.\nSetup Mocha gives us the possibility to load and run files before test files (with --file option). We use that option to run our setup.js file. This file opens only one browser for the whole campaign (and not one browser per test), since we\u0026rsquo;re then running each test file in its own context.\nBrowser helper This helper file is used to centralize the browser and tab functions called in all tests. This approach has one goal : to have the same browser’s configuration everywhere and of course to facilitate maintenance.\nThe functions that exist (for now) in this file are the following:\n createBrowser: used to create a browser with the global configuration, we create one browser for the whole campaign closeBrowser: usually called at the end of a run, to close the browser created and delete the downloaded files createBrowserContext: used to create a browser context, a browser can have multiple contexts that don\u0026rsquo;t share cookies/cache closeBrowserContext: usually called at the end of a test, to close the browser context created for the test newTab: allows us to open a new tab in a browser  Note that all these functions are used in mocha hooks functions in the global describe but can be called somewhere else.\nFiles Some of our tests need to create files (ex: Create files in BO), or to check some text in a PDF file (ex: Create and check invoice). For this specific need, we use some functions in Files.js.\nWhen a test is finished, all created files are deleted using a function from the same file : deleteFile, following the \u0026ldquo;cleaning behind\u0026rdquo; approach.\nRequire pages In each and every test, we require the pages that will be needed. The initialization is done when you require the class (no need to use the new keyword).\nExample:\n// For test \u0026#39;Filter Customer\u0026#39; const dashboardPage = require(\u0026#39;@pages/BO/dashboard\u0026#39;); const customersPage = require(\u0026#39;@pages/BO/customers\u0026#39;); Expect We use the expect keyword from the Chai library. This allows us to write assertions in a much more readable way. You can use whatever way to assert you want/need. Don’t forget that you can use the second argument of expect to log out a better error message when your assertion fails.\nExample :\nConst isCustomerConnected = await foLoginPage.isCustomerConnected(page); await expect(isCustomerConnected, \u0026#39;Customer is disconnected in FO\u0026#39;).to.be.true; Test identifier Our team thinks it’s very important to be able to follow how tests results evolve, so it’s been decided to add a unique identifier to every step in the test.\nWhy? To be able to identify each and every test and compare from one report to another, to know how the results change.\nFor example, you could have 10 failed tests one day, and 10 the day after. How do you know if it’s the same 10 tests failing, or another distribution (for example, 5 tests fixed, 5 other tests failing)? With this system we can calculate the trend and show it on the Nightly Board.\nWe first create a base context for each and every test file, and then we make a call to the function addContextItem with the unique value for this step, inside the test file.\nExample :\n// From test : UI/campaigns/functional/BO/04_customers/01_customers/07_helpCard.js const baseContext = \u0026#39;functional_BO_customers_customers_helpCard\u0026#39;; // And inside each `it`, we make a call // For example, in the “Go To Customer’s Page” step we will have : testContext.addContextItem(this, \u0026#39;testIdentifier\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;goToCustomersPage\u0026#39;, baseContext); // In the report, the final identifier will look like this: ‘functional_BO_customers_customers_filterAndQuickEditCustomers_goToCustomersPage’ Be careful, identifiers must be unique through the whole campaign ! We have a dedicated Github Action to help us find duplicates, so if you submit a PR we\u0026rsquo;ll see it directly.\nCleaning behind You must be able to launch a test independently, as well as in a whole campaign. That means :\n Your test must create its own data or rely on the default fixtures Your test must clean behind itself in a reliable manner Deleting files (invoices, images) and artifacts  The shop must end in the same state it was in before your test, as much as possible (since some actions are logged and create artifacts, that may not be always easy to clean though) and let subsequent tests run smoothly! That means deleting the items you created, reverting your changes, etc.\nA rule of thumb: can you launch your test suite multiple times? If yes, you know you’re not dependent on the data, and you’re properly cleaning behind.\nData Demo Data Our tests rely heavily on the demo fixtures (= demo data added when installing the vanilla PrestaShop package). However, we describe these data in separate files to make sure there’s no reference hard written in our code.\nThe only assumption we have to make is the presence of certain items like Orders or Products in the catalog after a vanilla installation.\nIf you need to rely on the fixtures too, make sure to use the description of the objects you’re looking for in the data folder. If it’s not complete, you can expand it and make a Pull Request, we’ll be happy to improve our datasets !\nFaker When we need to create new items, we rely on Faker to create random data.\nThis helps us make sure we’re testing with randomized sets of data and covering a lot of cases. It’s very important to check the specifications before to make sure you’re properly setting up your faker : input length, authorized characters, range of dates/values, etc.\n"

	"content": "How to contribute and create UI tests Architecture Page Object Model (also called Page Object Pattern) is a way to organize your code in a test framework. It encourages you to separate your test logic from your page manipulation logic.\nOur team uses POM as an architecture to organize the code: on one side we have our page logic, and on the other side we have our test logic.\nThe goal is to write your test code once, and only change the page logic when someone updates the application.\nBoth are described in the following paragraphs.\nPages Name The name of the class must be simple and linked to the page in the shop. You should be able to find the corresponding page in the application using the folder hierarchy, and the class name.\nThe convention for naming the file itself is different: the main page name is always index.js, while other pages should always have a relevant name.\nExample:\nFor BO products pages located at pages/catalog/products/, we use 2 classes:\n index.js for the products listing page (main page) add.js for the add/edit product page  Inheritance We heavily use inheritance in the pages to make sure all our generic methods are available from everywhere, and you don’t need to instantiate separate objects.\nThere is a main mother class, called CommonPage, located at the root of the pages folder.\nWe have another level of inheritance in each root folder (BO and FO) through the classes BOmainPage.js and FOMainPage.js. Of course, CommonPage is not meant to be instantiated (it’s kind of an abstract class) !\nWhen you create new page classes, make sure to make them inherit from their respective XXMainPage to be sure to be able to use both generic methods and specific methods.\nExamples:\n Install page (which is independent) extends from CommonPage Brands page (which is part of the BO) extends from BOBasePage Checkout page (which is part of the FO) extends from FOBasePage  Methods Methods inside a page class must be properly named about their primary function. Remember to KISS ! You should be able to understand what a method does just by looking at its name.\nMethods inside a page class CANNOT USE the expect keyword or any kind of asserting function, since their sole purpose is to interact with the page they’re linked with. They don’t validate anything per se, they just expose functionalities. To validate a behavior in your test logic, your methods can return booleans, integers (number of lines, elements, etc), strings, objects\u0026hellip; It’s up to you.\nExample:\n/** * Get order status * @param page * @return {Promise\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;} */ async getOrderStatus(page) { return this.getTextContent(page, `${this.orderStatusesSelect}option[selected=\u0026#39;selected\u0026#39;]`, false); } This method returns the text content of the selected option in the Status select element in the Orders page.\nSelectors Selectors are used on every page and are stored as attributes of the class. They should be named following this convention: nameType in camelCase, with name being the distinctive information about the element and type being its type (see below).\nFor example, a button used to submit the main form in the order page should be named: submitMainFormButton.\nTypes Each selector must belong to a certain type. Here is a non-exhaustive list:\n Button, link, block, image, icon, text, modal, other HTML elements\u0026hellip; Table, table-header, row, column, other table elements\u0026hellip; Form, input, select, radio, checkbox, other forms inputs\u0026hellip;  Tests Campaigns We currently have 2 campaigns implemented:\n Sanity: its purpose is to validate a Pull Request. Executed on Travis CI, this campaign must fully pass before merging the PR (one failed test blocks the merge). It consists of a few tests of the core features of PrestaShop: shop installation, orders/products pages in BO, and catalog/cart/checkout process in FO. Functional: it is the biggest and most important campaign. Its purpose is to validate that every feature of PrestaShop works, by testing them one by one. It goes on every page and tests whatever it can: table (filtering, ordering, quick edits, etc), CRUD items (orders, customers, products…), setting changes, etc.  We plan on implementing 2 more campaigns:\n End to end: its purpose is to check that popular user paths are working as intended. It will walk through the application and mimic a real user working on their daily routines as a merchant: checking products, generating invoices, creating a customer account, and an order, adding a special voucher for a specific user, etc. The selected user paths will be chosen by the Product Team. Thanks to their merchants and agencies interviews, they have a pretty good idea of what merchants do every day and how they use the software. Regression: a test campaign tailored to only target major and critical issues in the few last versions of PrestaShop, to make sure they don’t come back (hence the name).  Mocha and Mochawesome Mocha is our test runner (a framework that reads our test code and runs it). We use it in coordination with Mochawesome, a plugin for Mocha. Mochawesome produces a full JSON report in addition to a beautiful HTML report (which we don’t really use). The JSON file is sent to our Nightly Board, it is then inserted into the database to let visitors browse reports and visualize statistics.\nLambda function in describes Using lambda functions in mocha is discouraged. They bind this to the scope of the lambda function, making it impossible to use internal Mocha methods and objects. Since we may use the Mocha context to store some variables in the future, we strongly advise you to use the normal function() syntax.\nUtils The utils directory contain files that are necessary to run tests.\nGlobals This file contains all global variables that can be used in test files, pages and common tests.\nThe description of each variable in this file can be found in README.md.\nSetup Mocha gives us the possibility to load and run files before test files (with --file option). We use that option to run our setup.js file. This file opens only one browser for the whole campaign (and not one browser per test), since we\u0026rsquo;re then running each test file in its own context.\nBrowser helper This helper file is used to centralize the browser and tab functions called in all tests. This approach has one goal : to have the same browser’s configuration everywhere and of course to facilitate maintenance.\nThe functions that exist (for now) in this file are the following:\n createBrowser: used to create a browser with the global configuration, we create one browser for the whole campaign closeBrowser: usually called at the end of a run, to close the browser created and delete the downloaded files createBrowserContext: used to create a browser context, a browser can have multiple contexts that don\u0026rsquo;t share cookies/cache closeBrowserContext: usually called at the end of a test, to close the browser context created for the test newTab: allows us to open a new tab in a browser  Note that all these functions are used in mocha hooks functions in the global describe but can be called somewhere else.\nFiles Some of our tests need to create files (ex: Create files in BO), or to check some text in a PDF file (ex: Create and check invoice).

This means that every action needed for Grid must be added to GridActionCollection using add() method. You\u0026rsquo;ll find the list of existing actions in the documentation.\nHow to add Grid actions to a Grid using a module? You can add additional actions to any Grid by hooking to the Grid workflow. You have to follow these steps:\n Register hook action{gridId}GridDefinitionModifier where {gridId} is Grid id (e.g. customer for Customers grid, this means that hook name would be actionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier). Implement hook method in your module:  \u0026lt;?php // modules/mymodule/mymodule.php  class Mymodule extends Module { // ...  /** * Use hook to add Grid action for subscribing multiple customers to newsletter */ public function hookActionCustomerGridDefinitionModifier(array $params) { /** @var \\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\GridDefinition */ $gridDefinition = $params[\u0026#39;definition\u0026#39;]; $gridDefinition-\u0026gt;getGridActions() -\u0026gt;add( (new LinkGridAction(\u0026#39;new_action\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setName($this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;New action\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;MyModule.Admin.Actions\u0026#39;)) -\u0026gt;setIcon(\u0026#39;add_circle\u0026#39;) // icon from https://materializecss.com/icons.html by default  -\u0026gt;setOptions([ \u0026#39;route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;my_module_specific_route\u0026#39;, ]) ) ; } } Now you should be able to see new action available into the Customers grid!\nHow to create custom Grid action? PrestaShop already comes with a bunch of actions that are available for use in your Grids or for extending PrestaShop grids. However, in some use cases you may find that the existing actions do not fit your needs.\nLuckily, there is a solution, you can create and register your own custom actions.\nFirst, you need to create a Grid action itself:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/mymodule/src/Grid/Action/Type/  use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Action\\AbstractGridAction; /** * It extends AbstractGridAction, * but you can also implement \\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Action\\GridActionInterface * if for some reason you want to avoid using the abstract class */ final class MySpecificAction extends AbstractGridAction { /** * {@inheritdoc} */ public function getType() { return \u0026#39;my_specific\u0026#39;; } /** * {@inheritdoc} */ protected function configureOptions(OptionsResolver $resolver) { /** * options passed to the resolver will be available in the Grid action * and also in the template responsible of rendering the action. */ $resolver -\u0026gt;setRequired([ \u0026#39;route\u0026#39;, ]) -\u0026gt;setDefaults([ \u0026#39;route_params\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], ]) -\u0026gt;setAllowedTypes(\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;string\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;setAllowedTypes(\u0026#39;route_params\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;array\u0026#39;); } } Then you need to create template so it can render nicely in your grid.\n{# mymodule/views/PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/Actions/Grid/my_specific.html.twig #}\u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#39;%s_grid_action_%s\u0026#39;|format(grid.id, action.id) }}\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ path(action.options.route, action.options.route_params) }}\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;dropdown-item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {% if action.icon is not empty %}\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;material-icons\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ action.icon }}\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; {% endif %}{{ action.name }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Last thing is to add your newly created Grid action to Grid\u0026rsquo;s GridActionCollection and then it should be available in your Grid!\n"

The response is the image itself.\nDefault behaviour For most resources the url format is as follows: /api/images/{resource}/{resource_id}. You can use an additional parameter by appending the image format /api/images/{resource}/{resource_id}/{image_type}. In both cases, placeholders are:\n resource: the resource name (ex: categories, manufacturers, \u0026hellip;) resource_id: the integer ID to identify the resource image_type: the name of the image type requested (ex: small_default, category_default, \u0026hellip;)  This will return the target image as a response.\nGeneral shop The general image API only returns a list of images related to the shop configuration like the header or icon image. The /api/images/general returns the list of image types which you can then append to the URL (much like the image type in the default use case).\nFor example /api/images/general/header returns the header image.\nProduct images The product images API behaves mostly like the default ones, except that products may have multiple images, so the API contains an extra parameter for the image ID /api/images/products/{product_id}/{image_id}\nAdding a new image to a product We only refer to product here as it\u0026rsquo;s the only resource that has multiple images.

The response is the image itself.\nDefault behaviour For most resources the url format is as follows: /api/images/{resource}/{resource_id}. You can use an additional parameter by appending the image format /api/images/{resource}/{resource_id}/{image_type}. In both cases, placeholders are:\n resource: the resource name (ex: categories, manufacturers, \u0026hellip;) resource_id: the integer ID to identify the resource image_type: the name of the image type requested (ex: small_default, category_default, \u0026hellip;)  This will return the target image as a response.\nGeneral shop The general image API only returns a list of images related to the shop configuration like the header or icon image. The /api/images/general returns the list of image types which you can then append to the URL (much like the image type in the default use case).\nFor example /api/images/general/header returns the header image.\nProduct images The product images API behaves mostly like the default ones, except that products may have multiple images, so the API contains an extra parameter for the image ID /api/images/products/{product_id}/{image_id}\nAdding a new image to a product We only refer to product here as it\u0026rsquo;s the only resource that has multiple images.

	"title": "Minor release lifecycle",

	"description": "",
	"content": "Minor release lifecycle Kanban and scope Each minor version is defined by a feature scope, that is, a number of GitHub issues that we put in a version Kanban. How these issues are picked or sorted is the responsibility of the Product Team, who spends a lot of time gathering feedback from the PrestaShop community to make sure the next minor version addresses the most important needs.\nFor example PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 scope contained, but not only:\n Compatibility with php 7.3 Migration and rework of Back-office Order pages Advanced currencies management  Although it is very hard to estimate the size of this scope, we try to size it in order for the development phase to last 4 months.\nOnce this scope has been is completed – i.e all issues have reached the \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo; column of the Kanban – the project reaches the Feature Freeze stage.\nDuring this phase, no new items can be added to the version\u0026rsquo;s scope, unless they are bugs related to code changes performed during the development of this version – called regressions). However, this is a Feature Freeze, not a Code Freeze, so some older bugs may be added to the scope if it is considered opportune to fix them quickly before the release is out (e.g. security fixes).\nFeature Freeze Feature freeze means that all features of this version have been done and no new ones may be accepted in its scope. The project enters a phase of stabilization whose aim is to identify and fix all regressions) before it\u0026rsquo;s released.\nOnce this phase is started, Core maintainers create a git branch from develop branch which will carry the work to be done until the release (for 1.7.7.0, the branch name was 1.7.7.x). From this moment on, only bug fixes can be merged into this branch. Incidentally, this is also the branch where all future patch versions for this minor version will be developed on (hence the .x at the end).\nAlso, since stabilization is performed in a separate branch (1.7.7.x in our example), development for the next minor release (1.7.8 in our example) can start on the develop branch. This means that the development of any given minor version development actually starts (albeit slowly) precisely the moment the previous version enters feature freeze.\nThe QA team picks up the latest nightly build and starts a huge test campaign. The goal of this campaign is to find and register all regressions of this build.\nAs the QA team verifies the build, they will populate the Kanban with all the bugs they find. All important regressions must be fixed quickly. Although it depends heavily on the number of regressions found, this phase should last about one month. Once all major bugs have been fixed, the Beta phase can be launched.\nPublic Beta period When the branch reaches a point of maturity, which means only minor or trivial issues remain to be fixed, maintainers can create a Beta build using the .x branch codebase.\nThis Beta build is released publicly. During the month following this release, the community is very strongly encouraged to test it and give their feedback quickly: the sooner a problem is identified, the sooner it will be fixed. Remember that experts agree that the cost of fixing a bug grows exponentially with time – it is much cheaper to spend time now to ensure everything works well before the final release is out than to discover a bug in production later and lose business while a patch is prepared.\nDuring this one month, we continue testing and fixing the .x (following the stabilization goal) but we know that we can only test and imagine a limited amount of usecases. The community however knows better than us all the possible ways to use PrestaShop to build a business.\nSo everybody can help make this release better and more stable by testing it during the Beta phase.\nWhat does it mean to test a Beta build?\n If you use PrestaShop web services API for integration with other systems, make sure they work as expected If you build 1.7 modules or themes, test them on the new version If you know very well some of the modified/improved/reworked Back-office pages, please give them a try If you customized some parts of the shop, make sure they work well in the new version If you are hosting shops or providing maintenance services to merchants, import the data of one or two typical shops on a pre-production server and check the performance and the behavior of this version; you can also check that the update process is working as expected, depending on your favorite method  For example, if you are a payment module developer, just installing your module on this Beta software, processing one payment and telling us that everything is running as expected is already a great feedback.\nIf however you find a problem, you can\n Report this as a bug on GitHub (read how to report issues) Submit a bug fix by creating a pull request (read the contribution guidelines)  Release Candidate When Beta period ends, we consider that all the remaining regressions for this release are registered in the Kanban. So the aim is clear: fix them all, then ship.\nOnce all regressions have been fixed, maintainers deliver a Release Candidate Build using the .x branch codebase. This will be the Release Candidate 1 (also known as RC1).\nThis Build is extensively re-tested by the QA, then provided to everyone. Once released, the timer starts. We wait for one week. During this week we continue testing and exploring the Build, trying to find anything that would not have been detected earlier, and the community should do the same.\nBy the end of the week, if no new regression has been reported, the RC1 is rebranded and becomes the final release. The new minor version of PrestaShop is out.\nMost of the time, a couple final regressions will be reported. In that case, the bugs are fixed, an RC2 build is published, and the timer is reset. This cycle repeats until no new regressions are reported within the defined timeframe.\nFinally the latest built Release Candidate becomes the new latest stable PrestaShop software minor release.\nSummary  The cycle begins when development starts within the scope of a minor version release. When the scope of this version is finished, Feature Freeze is triggered.  Expected duration: 4 months\n Following Feature Freeze, a nightly build is picked up and tested extensively by QA team, who will then report all known defects. This will allow to plan, then deliver a Beta release.  Expected duration: 1 month\n The Beta Build is made available to all. Maintainers host a one-month long beta period to allow the community to test the build and submit feedback.  Expected duration: 1 month\n At the end of the Beta period, all regressions are fixed and maintainers deliver a Release Candidate 1 build. If bugs are reported, they are fixed in an RC2 build, and so on until a build has no issues reported within the following week. The last Release Candidate becomes the stable release.  Expected duration: from 1 week (if RC1 is flawless) to 1 month, possibly 2 months\nCalendar The global duration for all the process is about 6 months. This is why we expect to deliver at most 2 minor releases per year.\n(This article was originally published on our blog: PrestaShop 1.7 Minor Release Lifecycle )\n"

	"content": "Minor release lifecycle Kanban and scope Each minor version is defined by a feature scope, that is, a number of GitHub issues that we put in a version Kanban. How these issues are picked or sorted is the responsibility of the Product Team, who spends a lot of time gathering feedback from the PrestaShop community to make sure the next minor version addresses the most important needs.\nFor example PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 scope contained, but not only:\n Compatibility with php 7.3 Migration and rework of Back-office Order pages Advanced currencies management  Although it is very hard to estimate the size of this scope, we try to size it in order for the development phase to last 4 months.\nOnce this scope has been is completed – i.e all issues have reached the \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo; column of the Kanban – the project reaches the Feature Freeze stage.\nDuring this phase, no new items can be added to the version\u0026rsquo;s scope, unless they are bugs related to code changes performed during the development of this version – called regressions). However, this is a Feature Freeze, not a Code Freeze, so some older bugs may be added to the scope if it is considered opportune to fix them quickly before the release is out (e.g. security fixes).\nFeature Freeze Feature freeze means that all features of this version have been done and no new ones may be accepted in its scope. The project enters a phase of stabilization whose aim is to identify and fix all regressions) before it\u0026rsquo;s released.\nOnce this phase is started, Core maintainers create a git branch from develop branch which will carry the work to be done until the release (for 1.7.7.0, the branch name was 1.7.7.x). From this moment on, only bug fixes can be merged into this branch. Incidentally, this is also the branch where all future patch versions for this minor version will be developed on (hence the .x at the end).\nAlso, since stabilization is performed in a separate branch (1.7.7.x in our example), development for the next minor release (1.7.8 in our example) can start on the develop branch. This means that the development of any given minor version development actually starts (albeit slowly) precisely the moment the previous version enters feature freeze.\nThe QA team picks up the latest nightly build and starts a huge test campaign. The goal of this campaign is to find and register all regressions of this build.\nAs the QA team verifies the build, they will populate the Kanban with all the bugs they find. All important regressions must be fixed quickly. Although it depends heavily on the number of regressions found, this phase should last about one month. Once all major bugs have been fixed, the Beta phase can be launched.\nPublic Beta period When the branch reaches a point of maturity, which means only minor or trivial issues remain to be fixed, maintainers can create a Beta build using the .x branch codebase.\nThis Beta build is released publicly.

It also reduces memory consumption as services are, by default, created once and shared in the whole project.\nparameters:signatureImgDirectory:\u0026#39;signatures/\u0026#39;services:prestashop.module.demovieworderhooks:class:DemoViewOrderHooksfactory:[Module, getInstanceByName]arguments:- \u0026#39;demovieworderhooks\u0026#39;prestashop.module.demovieworderhooks.repository.order_repository:class:PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\Repository\\OrderRepositoryprestashop.module.demovieworderhooks.repository.order_signature_repository:class:PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\Repository\\OrderSignatureRepositoryfactory:[\u0026#39;@doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager\u0026#39;,getRepository]arguments:- PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\Entity\\OrderSignatureprestashop.module.demovieworderhooks.presenter.order_signature_presenter:class:PrestaShop\\Module\\DemoViewOrderHooks\\Presenter\\OrderSignaturePresenterarguments:- \u0026#39;@=service(\u0026#34;prestashop.module.demovieworderhooks\u0026#34;).getPathUri() ~ parameter(\u0026#34;signatureImgDirectory\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;Let\u0026rsquo;s create a twig templates in modules/demovieworderhooks/views/templates/admin/:\ncard.html.twig\n{% trans_default_domain \u0026#39;Module.Demovieworderhooks.Admin\u0026#39; %}\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;card\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;card-header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3 class=\u0026#34;card-header-title\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {% block card_title %}{% endblock %}\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;card-body\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {% block card_body %}{% endblock %}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; customer_signature.html.twig extending card.html.twig\n{% extends \u0026#39;@Modules/demovieworderhooks/views/templates/admin/card.html.twig\u0026#39; %}{% block card_title %}{{ \u0026#39;Signature\u0026#39;|trans }}{% endblock %}{% block card_body %}\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-lg\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;display-4 text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ signature.gender }}{{ signature.firstName }}{{ signature.lastName }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;{{ signature.imagePath }}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {% endblock %}Lets add several methods to DemoViewOrderHooks class. getModuleTemplatePath - get\u0026rsquo;s the path of the templates folder.\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Get path to this module\u0026#39;s template directory */ private function getModuleTemplatePath(): string { return sprintf(\u0026#39;@Modules/%s/views/templates/admin/\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;name); } Render a twig template method:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Render a twig template. */ private function render(string $template, array $params = []): string { /** @var Twig_Environment $twig */ $twig = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;twig\u0026#39;); return $twig-\u0026gt;render($template, $params); } For each registered hook, you must create a non-static public method, starting with the “hook” keyword followed by the name of the hook you want to use (starting with either “display” or “action”).

	"title": "Testing access to the Webservice",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Testing access to the Webservice Now that your access key is generated you can test your store\u0026rsquo;s webservice, its endpoint is located in the /api/ uri at the root of your installation of Prestashop.\nAccessing /api/ The quickest way to test your API is to use your browser:\n If PrestaShop is installed at the root of your server, you can access the API here: http://example.com/api/ If PrestaShop is installed in a subfolder of your server, you can access the API here: http://example.com/prestashop/api/  Browser prompt The shop should prompt you for a username and a password to enter. The username is the authentication key you created and there is no password to enter. If no permission has been set for the key, than the browser will keep asking you to enter the key indefinitely.\nInclude key in url (risky) The second way to access the API is to include your access key in the url, this will prevent you from entering any user name. Here is an example, assuming your access API key is UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX:\n At the root of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/api/ In a subfolder of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/prestashop/api/  This method might be convenient for development but very risky as you expose your API key directly in the url, so anyone able to see (or hack) your browser history or access logs would be able to get your key. This should never be used on a production shop. Using an Authorization header (recommended) The best way to authenticate your API calls is to use an Authorization header, this way you don\u0026rsquo;t expose your API key directly but a base64_encode compute of your user:password couple. Although PrestaShop API only has a user with empty password, so in order to compute your authorization key you can do as follows:\n\u0026lt;?php $apiKey = `UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX`; $authorizationKey = base64_encode($apiKey . \u0026#39;:\u0026#39;); // VUNDTExROU4yQVJTSFdDWExUNzRLVUtTU0szNEJGS1g6 Then you can use this value in your request header:\n   Key Value     Authorization Basic VUNDTExROU4yQVJTSFdDWExUNzRLVUtTU0szNEJGS1g6    To test/call your APIs we recommend you use an API client such as Insomnia or Postman, it is easier to call the APIs than with a browser, you can easily switch with HTTP methods, and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to set request parameters and headers.\nAs you noticed no password nor authentication process is required to access the APIs which is why you need to be extra careful with your access key rights and how (and to whom) you disclose them. Available resources The /api/ URL gives you the root of all the resources, in the form of an XML file. Here is an example of what you should see if you authorized full access to addresses, images and products resources:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;

	"content": "Testing access to the Webservice Now that your access key is generated you can test your store\u0026rsquo;s webservice, its endpoint is located in the /api/ uri at the root of your installation of Prestashop.\nAccessing /api/ The quickest way to test your API is to use your browser:\n If PrestaShop is installed at the root of your server, you can access the API here: http://example.com/api/ If PrestaShop is installed in a subfolder of your server, you can access the API here: http://example.com/prestashop/api/  Browser prompt The shop should prompt you for a username and a password to enter. The username is the authentication key you created and there is no password to enter. If no permission has been set for the key, than the browser will keep asking you to enter the key indefinitely.\nInclude key in url (risky) The second way to access the API is to include your access key in the url, this will prevent you from entering any user name. Here is an example, assuming your access API key is UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX:\n At the root of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/api/ In a subfolder of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/prestashop/api/  This method might be convenient for development but very risky as you expose your API key directly in the url, so anyone able to see (or hack) your browser history or access logs would be able to get your key. This should never be used on a production shop. Using an Authorization header (recommended) The best way to authenticate your API calls is to use an Authorization header, this way you don\u0026rsquo;t expose your API key directly but a base64_encode compute of your user:password couple. Although PrestaShop API only has a user with empty password, so in order to compute your authorization key you can do as follows:\n\u0026lt;?php $apiKey = `UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX`; $authorizationKey = base64_encode($apiKey . \u0026#39;:\u0026#39;); // VUNDTExROU4yQVJTSFdDWExUNzRLVUtTU0szNEJGS1g6 Then you can use this value in your request header:\n   Key Value     Authorization Basic VUNDTExROU4yQVJTSFdDWExUNzRLVUtTU0szNEJGS1g6    To test/call your APIs we recommend you use an API client such as Insomnia or Postman, it is easier to call the APIs than with a browser, you can easily switch with HTTP methods, and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to set request parameters and headers.\nAs you noticed no password nor authentication process is required to access the APIs which is why you need to be extra careful with your access key rights and how (and to whom) you disclose them. Available resources The /api/ URL gives you the root of all the resources, in the form of an XML file. Here is an example of what you should see if you authorized full access to addresses, images and products resources:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;

	"content": "Using Vue.js Depending on the PrestaShop version running on the shop, either on the back or the front-office, at least one template renderer is available to display content on the page. With Javascript, it is possible to update \u0026amp; animate the page content without having to refresh the page.\njQuery is available on PrestaShop to help implementing these interface updates. For complex interfaces, with state management for instance, other frontend options could be considered. Vue.js is a JavaScript Framework that will be helpful in this case. This chapter covers its integration on a module.\n FAQ about Vue.js   1- Creation of a Vue.js application in the module directories The objective of this part is to make Vue.js available in the project.\nWe will store the Vue.js source code in a dedicated folder that will be present in the module only during the development part. Running Vue.js will be possible by compiling and storing the JS files in the proper assets folder.\nDuring this tutorial, we use a new folder _dev that will be created at the root directory of the module.\nInstallation of Vue.js can be done via several ways, but we will use the CLI option to get all the stack.\n Installation of Vue.js CLI tool (globally)  $ npm install -g @vue/cli  Creation of the project  $ vue create _dev We chose the preset with Vue 2 \u0026amp; Babel for this tutorial.\nAfter the initialization process with some questions and downloads, a whole standalone application will be created and available in the _dev folder. Running npm commands are defined in the package.json file to run or build it.\n$ cd _dev $ npm run build At the moment, we have a Vue.js application that can run independantly from the module.

	"content": "Using Vue.js Depending on the PrestaShop version running on the shop, either on the back or the front-office, at least one template renderer is available to display content on the page. With Javascript, it is possible to update \u0026amp; animate the page content without having to refresh the page.\njQuery is available on PrestaShop to help implementing these interface updates. For complex interfaces, with state management for instance, other frontend options could be considered. Vue.js is a JavaScript Framework that will be helpful in this case. This chapter covers its integration on a module.\n FAQ about Vue.js   1- Creation of a Vue.js application in the module directories The objective of this part is to make Vue.js available in the project.\nWe will store the Vue.js source code in a dedicated folder that will be present in the module only during the development part. Running Vue.js will be possible by compiling and storing the JS files in the proper assets folder.\nDuring this tutorial, we use a new folder _dev that will be created at the root directory of the module.\nInstallation of Vue.js can be done via several ways, but we will use the CLI option to get all the stack.\n Installation of Vue.js CLI tool (globally)  $ npm install -g @vue/cli  Creation of the project  $ vue create _dev We chose the preset with Vue 2 \u0026amp; Babel for this tutorial.\nAfter the initialization process with some questions and downloads, a whole standalone application will be created and available in the _dev folder. Running npm commands are defined in the package.json file to run or build it.\n$ cd _dev $ npm run build At the moment, we have a Vue.js application that can run independantly from the module. In the next parts, this standalone application will be adapted to run inside a PrestaShop page.\n2- Cleanup Supposing that the Vue.js workspace is the _dev folder:\n Remove the _dev/public/ folder. In the _dev/package.json folder, remove the serve script.  3- Customization of the application for a PrestaShop context In the module structure, JavaScript files must be stored in views/js/.

	"content": "Create Admin module controllers   Since 1.7.3 you create and override templates and services in your modules. Since 1.7.4, you can create and override forms and console commands. Since 1.7.5, you can create your own \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; controllers! Since 1.7.7, you can decorate Core controllers  Starting on PrestaShop 1.7.5, you can rely on the modern environment to add new entry points to your applications.\nUsing modern pages, you will have access to the PrestaShop debug toolbar, the service container, Twig and Doctrine, among others. For your views, the PrestaShop UI Kit is available, built on top of Bootstrap 4 and ensuring your views are consistent with the PrestaShop Back Office.\nHow to declare a new Controller  Somewhere in your module declare a new class that will act as a Controller:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/your-module/src/Controller/DemoController.php  namespace MyModule\\Controller; use Doctrine\\Common\\Cache\\CacheProvider; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class DemoController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { private $cache; // you can use symfony DI to inject services  public function __construct(CacheProvider $cache) { $this-\u0026gt;cache = $cache; } public function demoAction() { return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@Modules/your-module/templates/admin/demo.html.twig\u0026#39;); } } If you want Symfony Dependency Injection to inject services into your controller, you need to use specific YAML service declaration:\nservices:# The name of the service must match the full namespace classMyModule\\Controller\\DemoController:class:MyModule\\Controller\\DemoControllerarguments:- \u0026#39;@doctrine.cache.provider\u0026#39;You can also retrieve services with the container available in symfony controllers -\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/your-module/src/Controller/DemoController.php  namespace MyModule\\Controller; use Doctrine\\Common\\Cache\\CacheProvider; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class DemoController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { public function demoAction() { // you can also retrieve services directly from the container  $cache = $this-\u0026gt;container-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;doctrine.cache\u0026#39;); return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@Modules/your-module/templates/admin/demo.html.twig\u0026#39;); } } You have access to the Container, to Twig as rendering engine, the Doctrine ORM, everything from Symfony framework ecosystem.

You can define a specific type depending on the column. You can basically use any Symfony form type (including your custom ones) and PrestaShop provides a few filter types that might be useful to you.\nFilterable grid definition  Starting the 1.7.7 we made it even easier, you can use the AbstractFilterableGridDefinitionFactory. This will allow you use the common search controller.\n\u0026lt;?php final class AddressGridDefinitionFactory extends AbstractFilterableGridDefinitionFactory { const GRID_ID = \u0026#39;address\u0026#39;; /** * {@inheritdoc} */ protected function getId() { return self::GRID_ID; } ... } Filters class You need to define a Filters class linked to your Grid, it will allow you to define the default filters and sorting values. It will also make your list action simpler as PrestaShop provides a parameter resolver responsible of automatically create and fill a Filters object.\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Search\\Filters; /** * Class ManufacturerFilters is responsible for providing filter values for manufacturer grid. */ final class ManufacturerFilters extends Filters { /** @var string */ protected $filterId = ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory::GRID_ID; /** * {@inheritdoc} */ public static function getDefaults() { return [ \u0026#39;limit\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 10, \u0026#39;offset\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 0, \u0026#39;orderBy\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;sortOrder\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;asc\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;filters\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], ]; } } Controller actions The Grid filtering workflow is divided into three actions:\n search action: it parses the filters from the POST request, then redirects to the list action list action: it parses the filters from GET request, persists them into database and finally renders the grid reset action: it cleans the persisted filters and reset to the default ones  In this tutorial we assume the search and list actions have the same url, thus we don\u0026rsquo;t need to specify the search route in the form action. Search manages the POST request and list the GET request. Most of the time you will use the default form factory when you configure your grid factory which is usually enough. However if you need to change the form action route or perform any other advanced management you might need to create your custom form factory.

You can define a specific type depending on the column. You can basically use any Symfony form type (including your custom ones) and PrestaShop provides a few filter types that might be useful to you.\nFilterable grid definition  Starting the 1.7.7 we made it even easier, you can use the AbstractFilterableGridDefinitionFactory. This will allow you use the common search controller.\n\u0026lt;?php final class AddressGridDefinitionFactory extends AbstractFilterableGridDefinitionFactory { const GRID_ID = \u0026#39;address\u0026#39;; /** * {@inheritdoc} */ protected function getId() { return self::GRID_ID; } ... } Filters class You need to define a Filters class linked to your Grid, it will allow you to define the default filters and sorting values. It will also make your list action simpler as PrestaShop provides a parameter resolver responsible of automatically create and fill a Filters object.\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Search\\Filters; /** * Class ManufacturerFilters is responsible for providing filter values for manufacturer grid. */ final class ManufacturerFilters extends Filters { /** @var string */ protected $filterId = ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory::GRID_ID; /** * {@inheritdoc} */ public static function getDefaults() { return [ \u0026#39;limit\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 10, \u0026#39;offset\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 0, \u0026#39;orderBy\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;sortOrder\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;asc\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;filters\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [], ]; } } Controller actions The Grid filtering workflow is divided into three actions:\n search action: it parses the filters from the POST request, then redirects to the list action list action: it parses the filters from GET request, persists them into database and finally renders the grid reset action: it cleans the persisted filters and reset to the default ones  In this tutorial we assume the search and list actions have the same url, thus we don\u0026rsquo;t need to specify the search route in the form action. Search manages the POST request and list the GET request. Most of the time you will use the default form factory when you configure your grid factory which is usually enough. However if you need to change the form action route or perform any other advanced management you might need to create your custom form factory. Search action Custom search controller You can use the ResponseBuilder service to easily create the search response, it only needs four arguments as input:\n the definition factory the request the filter ID the list route for redirection  \u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory; use PrestaShopBundle\\Service\\Grid\\ResponseBuilder; use PrestaShopBundle\\Security\\Annotation\\AdminSecurity; use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request; use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\RedirectResponse; class ManufacturerController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { ... /** * Provides filters functionality * * @AdminSecurity(\u0026#34;is_granted(\u0026#39;read\u0026#39;, request.get(\u0026#39;_legacy_controller\u0026#39;))\u0026#34;) * * @param Request $request * * @return RedirectResponse */ public function searchAction(Request $request) { /** @var ResponseBuilder $responseBuilder */ $responseBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.bundle.grid.response_builder\u0026#39;); return $responseBuilder-\u0026gt;buildSearchResponse( $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.grid.definition.factory.manufacturer\u0026#39;), $request, ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory::GRID_ID, \u0026#39;admin_manufacturers_index\u0026#39; ); } ... } # your-module/config/routes.ymladmin_manufacturers_search:path:/methods:POSTdefaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle:Admin/Sell/Catalog/Manufacturer:search\u0026#39;_legacy_controller:AdminManufacturers_legacy_link:AdminManufacturers:submitFiltermanufacturerCommon search controller  As this controller is almost always the same, starting 1.7.7, we introduced a common controller.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Use hooks on modern pages You know you can already customize your PrestaShop store thanks to many hooks: the good news is that you can still use hooks like you did in the earlier versions of PrestaShop in modern pages.\nStarting from PrestaShop 1.7.3, you can access the modern Services Container into your modules and so on access powerful and customizable features available in Symfony:\n Twig, the most popular templating engine; Swiftmailer, a feature-rich mailer; Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL to manage your database; Filesystem and Finder libraries to manage all filesystem operations; Monolog for every logging operations; Serializer library for whom who need to manipulate Json and Xml formats\u0026hellip;  Of course, you also have access to every service used by the Core of PrestaShop. This means that you can rely on all services defined in PrestaShopBundle/config/ folder, except from the ones declared in adapter folder: they will be removed at some point.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what a service is, have a look at the Symfony documentation about the service container. Better modules on modern pages Let\u0026rsquo;s say your customer want an xml export button directly available from list of products on Product Catalog page: such a common need regarding the number of related modules in the Store.\nHow hard it can be to develop a module that provide this button? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not! Let\u0026rsquo;s do this feature together.\nFirst step: select the right hook Accessing the Product Catalog page in debug mode we can access the list of available hooks in the debug toolbar:\n moduleRoutes displayBackOfficeHeader displayBackOfficeTop actionAdminControllerSetMedia displayDashboardToolbarTopMenu displayDashboardTop hookdisplayDashboardToolbarIcons displayBackOfficeFooter displayAdminNavBarBeforeEnd displayAdminAfterHeader actionDispatcherBefore actionDispatcherAfter  As we need to act on Dashboard but after the header, in the icons toolbar (with others export options) hookdisplayDashboardToolbarIcons sounds like the hook we are looking for.\nSecond step: create and register the Hook Create a new module called foo and register the hook. You should end up with this kind of code in your module:\n\u0026lt;?php // foo.php  /* ... */ /** * Module installation. * * @return bool Success of the installation */ public function install() { return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayDashboardToolbarIcons\u0026#39;); } /** * Add an \u0026#34;XML export\u0026#34; action in Product Catalog page. * * @return bool Success of the installation */ public function hookDisplayDashboardToolbarIcons($hookParams) { if ($this-\u0026gt;isSymfonyContext() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $hookParams[\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;] === \u0026#39;admin_product_catalog\u0026#39;) { // to be continued  } }  The route property is only available for modern pages. To find out the route for a given page, look at the Debug toolbar. Third step: create your own product serializer At this point, this is basic PHP code we need to produce. We need to retrieve the list of products from database, and serialize them into XML and dump into a file sent to the user.\nUsing Doctrine (DBAL) to retrieve data Even if using old way to retrieve data is still valid (Product::getProducts or through the webservice), we\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce a best practice here: using a repository and get rid of the Object model. This has a lot of advantages, you rely on database instead of model and you\u0026rsquo;ll have better performances and control on your data.\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Repository/ProductRepository.php namespace Foo\\Repository; use Doctrine\\DBAL\\Connection; class ProductRepository { /** * @var Connection the Database connection. */ private $connection; /** * @var string the Database prefix. */ private $databasePrefix; public function __construct(Connection $connection, $databasePrefix) { $this-\u0026gt;connection = $connection; $this-\u0026gt;databasePrefix = $databasePrefix; } /** * @param int $langId the lang id * @return array the list of products */ public function findAllbyLangId(int $langId) { $prefix = $this-\u0026gt;databasePrefix; $productTable = \u0026#34;${prefix}product\u0026#34;; $productLangTable = \u0026#34;${prefix}product_lang\u0026#34;; $query = \u0026#34;SELECT p.* FROM ${productTable}p LEFT JOIN ${productLangTable}pl ON (p.`id_product` = pl.`id_product`) WHERE pl.`id_lang` = :langId\u0026#34;; $statement = $this-\u0026gt;connection-\u0026gt;prepare($query); $statement-\u0026gt;bindValue(\u0026#39;langId\u0026#39;, $langId); $statement-\u0026gt;execute(); return $statement-\u0026gt;fetchAll(); } } And declare your repository as a service:\n# modules/foo/config/services.ymlservices:product_repository:class:Foo\\Repository\\ProductRepositoryarguments:[\u0026#39;@doctrine.dbal.default_connection\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;%database_prefix%\u0026#39;]Prestashop automatically checks if modules have a config/services.yml file and will autoload it for you. In order to force Prestashop to parse the file, you need to clear the cache:\n./bin/console cache:clear --no-warmup You can now use it in your module (and everywhere in PrestaShop modern pages!):\n\u0026lt;?php // foo.php  /* ... */ /** * Get the list of products for a specific lang. */ public function hookDisplayDashboardToolbarIcons($hookParams) { if ($this-\u0026gt;isSymfonyContext() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $hookParams[\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;] === \u0026#39;admin_product_catalog\u0026#39;) { $products = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;product_repository\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;findAllByLangId(1); dump($products); } } In Product Catalog Page you should see the list of Products in debug toolbar in \u0026ldquo;Dump\u0026rdquo; section:\nUsing the Symfony components to create an XML export file Now we retrieve the product list from our module and that we are able to display the information into the back office, we could already create our XML file with raw PHP. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can do it using the components provided by Symfony \u0026ldquo;out of box\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026lt;?php // foo.php  /* ... */ /** * Creates an XML file with list of products in \u0026#34;upload\u0026#34; folder. * * @return bool Success of the installation */ public function hookDisplayDashboardToolbarIcons($hookParams) { if ($this-\u0026gt;isSymfonyContext() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $hookParams[\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;] === \u0026#39;admin_product_catalog\u0026#39;) { $products = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;product_repository\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;findAllByLangId(1); $productsXml = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;serializer\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;serialize( $products, \u0026#39;xml\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;xml_root_node_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;products\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;xml_format_output\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, ] ); $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;filesystem\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;dumpFile(_PS_UPLOAD_DIR_.\u0026#39;products.xml\u0026#39;, $productsXml); } }  Note: the serializer service is not enabled in PrestaShop 1.7.3 but will be enabled in 1.7.4. If you really want to enable it in 1.7.3, uncomment the following configuration line in your services.yml file of your Shop. # app/config/services.ymlservices:# Enables the serializerframework:serializer:{enable_annotations:true}Render the icon using Twig templating engine Now we have serialized our products, it\u0026rsquo;s time to render an Icon link with the file to download!\nWe could (of course) use Smarty to render a template, but it\u0026rsquo;s a chance to discover Twig which is also available as a service. First, let\u0026rsquo;s refactor and finalize our hook call:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Make products export in XML. * * @param $params array */ public function hookDisplayDashboardToolbarIcons($params) { if ($this-\u0026gt;isSymfonyContext() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $params[\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;] === \u0026#39;admin_product_catalog\u0026#39;) { $products = $this-\u0026gt;getProducts(1); $productsXml = $this-\u0026gt;serializeProducts($products); $filepath = _PS_ROOT_DIR_.\u0026#39;/products.xml\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;writeFile($productsXml, $filepath); return $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;twig\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@Modules/Foo/download_link.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;filepath\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; _PS_BASE_URL_.\u0026#39;/products.xml\u0026#39;, ]); } }  We have extracted business logic into specific functions. And now, the template:\n{# in views/PrestaShop/Foo/download_link.twig #}\u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;desc-product-export\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;list-toolbar-btn\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ filepath }}\u0026#34; download\u0026gt; \u0026lt;b data-toggle=\u0026#34;pstooltip\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;label-tooltip\u0026#34; data-original-title=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;Export XML\u0026#34;|trans({}, \u0026#39;Module.Foo\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34; data-html=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; data-placement=\u0026#34;top\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;material-icons\u0026#34;\u0026gt;cloud_upload\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;  We have used a key for translation, making our own translations available in back office when using Twig. And \u0026ldquo;voila!\u0026rdquo;, the module could be of course improved with so many features, adding filters on export for instance, using the request hook parameter and updating the Product repository.\n"

	"content": "Use hooks on modern pages You know you can already customize your PrestaShop store thanks to many hooks: the good news is that you can still use hooks like you did in the earlier versions of PrestaShop in modern pages.\nStarting from PrestaShop 1.7.3, you can access the modern Services Container into your modules and so on access powerful and customizable features available in Symfony:\n Twig, the most popular templating engine; Swiftmailer, a feature-rich mailer; Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL to manage your database; Filesystem and Finder libraries to manage all filesystem operations; Monolog for every logging operations; Serializer library for whom who need to manipulate Json and Xml formats\u0026hellip;  Of course, you also have access to every service used by the Core of PrestaShop. This means that you can rely on all services defined in PrestaShopBundle/config/ folder, except from the ones declared in adapter folder: they will be removed at some point.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what a service is, have a look at the Symfony documentation about the service container. Better modules on modern pages Let\u0026rsquo;s say your customer want an xml export button directly available from list of products on Product Catalog page: such a common need regarding the number of related modules in the Store.\nHow hard it can be to develop a module that provide this button? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not! Let\u0026rsquo;s do this feature together.\nFirst step: select the right hook Accessing the Product Catalog page in debug mode we can access the list of available hooks in the debug toolbar:\n moduleRoutes displayBackOfficeHeader displayBackOfficeTop actionAdminControllerSetMedia displayDashboardToolbarTopMenu displayDashboardTop hookdisplayDashboardToolbarIcons displayBackOfficeFooter displayAdminNavBarBeforeEnd displayAdminAfterHeader actionDispatcherBefore actionDispatcherAfter  As we need to act on Dashboard but after the header, in the icons toolbar (with others export options) hookdisplayDashboardToolbarIcons sounds like the hook we are looking for.\nSecond step: create and register the Hook Create a new module called foo and register the hook. You should end up with this kind of code in your module:\n\u0026lt;?php // foo.php  /* ... */ /** * Module installation. * * @return bool Success of the installation */ public function install() { return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;displayDashboardToolbarIcons\u0026#39;); } /** * Add an \u0026#34;XML export\u0026#34; action in Product Catalog page. * * @return bool Success of the installation */ public function hookDisplayDashboardToolbarIcons($hookParams) { if ($this-\u0026gt;isSymfonyContext() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $hookParams[\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;] === \u0026#39;admin_product_catalog\u0026#39;) { // to be continued  } }  The route property is only available for modern pages.

	"uri": "https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/sell/techvalidation-checklist/",
	"title": "Validation checklist",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Module validation checklist First of all, the submitted addon must pass the validator. Some reports will lead to an automatic decline if found. The following rules are manually checked by the modules team.\nCommon rules Code review Module structure is followed The module respected the expected structure.\nLicense is compatible A module and its dependencies must be compatible with the OSL (core) and AFL (modules and themes) licenses used to manage and distribute the PrestaShop open source project. Compatible licences are:\n Apache license AFL MIT BSD ISC EUPL  Additionally, distribution licenses like CC-0 or CC-by-sa are appropriate for artwork (e.g: icons, pictures, fonts, but not only)\nCore tables are untouched Module may create all the table they need in the database. However altering core table is forbidden.\nIn case you wanted to add columns for an existing table, the workaround is to create a new table with a foreign key targetting the primary key of the core table.\nOther modules are not altered Modifying core or other modules files is not allowed.\nFile storage in proper directory Module may add / modify some files on the shop. To avoid issues with file permissions, we recommend storing files in the var/%env% directory.\nUse of iFrames is limited to highly secured websites The use of iframes is highly discouraged for security reasons, although they are implemented in different part of the core like in Payment Modules.\n  Using an iframe authorizes to load content from a site that is not controlled by the PrestaShop app. This is the same problem as authorizing to load javascript files from an external source. If the source is being hacked, the attacker could potentially exploit other failures to take control of all the shops that would have installed the module.\n  Therefore we need to check what your processes are, to ensure the security of the content that will be injected by this iframe into all the shops that will install the module. When submitting your module, the validation team will review the reasons why an iFrame is needed for this business and what are the measures taken by the provider to prevent attacks.\n  Module does not rely on external assets The zip you send to PrestaShop Addons must be totally self-sufficient.\nAll the content needed by the module to work properly must be present in the archive. No external content should be downloaded by the module after installation.\nSupport goes though the PrestaShop Marketplace When a module is published on the marketplace, we provide a unique way for all customer to get new updates and to contact the maintainer of the different modules \u0026amp; themes they bought.\nInserting links to an external platform would probably make things easier for a seller, but it would prevent us to help customers and/or seller in case of dispute.\nSQL requests variables are sanitized We examine every SQL request to make sure you did cast your variables. Use (int) for integers and pSQL() for strings.\nMore details:\n Using the DBQuery class Executing your SQL requests  Calls from external services are secured If you have PHP files to handle ajax or external calls, make sure to secure that file. To do so, create a unique token during the module\u0026rsquo;s installation and use it during the call verification.\nMethods with security risks are not used Using serialize() / unserialize() is forbidden, as they are a security risk if you do not control the data going through these methods. They may lead to remote code execution, so we recommend using json_encode() / json_decode() instead.\nThe archive has only one module Module included in another one are difficult to review \u0026amp; can\u0026rsquo;t have their own release process.\nEach module has to be uploaded on the marketplace separately, even if they only work together.\nA file index.php exists in each folder To prevent someone to reach the content of a repository without, a file index.php has to be found in each folder.\nAs we deal with a security risk on some environments, we strongly recommend you comply with this rule. An \u0026ldquo;autoindex\u0026rdquo; tool allows you to add in each folder.\nHTML code is written in templates Use Smarty / Twig templates to display HTML code to respect PrestaShop patterns (MVC architecture) and build a code easy to maintain.\n More details in displaying content.  Code is written in English PrestaShop provides a e-commerce software ready use in many languages. The code and displayed texts are written in English, then translated if the user switches to another language.\nLike for PrestaShop, the code submitted on the marketplace has to be written in English, even if the only user of this code is likely to from only one country or language. A lang unknown by the reviewer would make the validation impossible to do.\nRisk of conflicts between modules is low  Configuration keys  Configuration data is shared between the shop and every module installed. This is convenient if your need to get a value from another part of the shop, but include some risks if two modules stores some data in the same key.\nToo avoid conflicts, configuration keys must be prefixed by the module name. For instance, using a configuration key in the module TheModule would be:\n\u0026lt;?php Configuration::get(\u0026#39;THE_MODULE_PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;); Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;THE_MODULE_PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;, [...]); instead of\n\u0026lt;?php Configuration::get(\u0026#39;PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;); Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;, [...]);  Classes  This also applies to classes defined outside a namespace. Having the module name as a prefix will reduce the risk of colision between classes.\nAjax / Cron tasks are secured \u0026amp; in a controller All the AJAX and CRON files must be protected with a unique and secured token to avoid any security issues (outside attacks,\u0026hellip;). Even the front controllers must be secured with a secured token when you use AJAX in it.\nAJAX and CRON scripts must be placed in a controller and not in a separate script to call on its own. For more details:\n Documentation Original issue leading to the use of ModuleFrontControllers  Code in hook is run only when needed Several hooks are called on all pages of the back-office or front-office. When a module is registered on one of them, it may impact the page performance on low-end servers if it runs too much code.\nWe ask to keep the code running in your hooks light, and filter the pages you module runs on if necessary.\nExamples:\n Module filtering the creation of orders from another module  \u0026lt;?php /** * Hook executed at the order confirmation */ public function hookOrderConfirmation($params) { # If created by another module, return.  if ($params[\u0026#39;order\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;module !== $this-\u0026gt;name) { return false; } // [...]  }  Filter for a hook called on all BO pages:  \u0026lt;?php /** * Display content ONLY in the admin payment controller */ public function hookDisplayAdminAfterHeader() { $currentController = $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;controller_name; if (\u0026#39;AdminPayment\u0026#39; !== $currentController) { return false; } // [...]  // return $this-\u0026gt;display(...)  } Debug statements are cleaned All the debug tests have to be removed.\nExample : var_dump($a), dump($a), console.log(‘a’)\u0026hellip;\nCommented code is removed To have a code easier to maintain / review, you must remove the commented lines of code. Code comments are welcome of course!\nCommented code to be removed:\n\u0026lt;?php public function hookPaymentOptions($params) { // if (false === $this-\u0026gt;active) { // \u0026lt;-- never called, to be removed  // return false;  // }  if (false === $this-\u0026gt;merchantIsValid()) { return false; } // if (false === $this-\u0026gt;checkCurrency($params[\u0026#39;cart\u0026#39;])) // {  // return false;  // }  // if (false === $this-\u0026gt;isPaymentStep()) {  // return false;  // }  // [...]  return $payment_options; } Encouraged code comments:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Add payment option at the checkout in the front office * * @param array $params return by the hook * * @return array|false all payment option available */ public function hookPaymentOptions($params) { // [...]  return $payment_options; } Empty \u0026amp; generated files are removed As they have no consequences in the module execution, empty files can be removed before submission. Generated files such as log files, invoice or other documents in PDFs etc. should be removed as well, as they:\n increase the weight of your submissions, add a risk of overwritten files when deployed on a shop, aren\u0026rsquo;t needed to run the module, could contain some personal information.  Documentation is provided Documentation is found in the docs/ folder of the module, and in a format widly used (PDF is recommended, avoid ZIP files which need an additional process of extraction).\nFunctional review No PHP errors is thrown in debug mode A module must be tested on a Prestashop with debug mode enabled in order to spot the slightest mistake. Validation teams always have this mode enabled and if an alert is raised then the module will be rejected.\nOn production mode, only PHP errors will be detected as they prevent the page to be fully executed. On development mode, all other levels of messages such as notices \u0026amp; warnings are triggered.\nPayment modules rules We do have extra rules for Payment Modules as this type of modules require higher security. Note that there are some modules which create the Order with a pending order status during the payment processing (1), while others wait for the payment system\u0026rsquo;s approval to create it (2). But none of them create an order before the customer passed the payment service (bank, PayPal\u0026hellip;).\n  Make sure you double check the id_cart before creating the order.\n The purpose is to make sure another customer cannot validate a cart which isn\u0026rsquo;t his.    if (2), make sure the amount you use to validateOrder() comes from the external payment system. Do not use Cart-\u0026gt;getOrderTotal();\n For security reasons, always proceed as explained.    For (2), when receiving a call to process the payment, make sure you double check the source of the call using a signature or a token. Those values must not be known of all.\n  "

	"title": "Validation checklist",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Module validation checklist First of all, the submitted addon must pass the validator. Some reports will lead to an automatic decline if found. The following rules are manually checked by the modules team.\nCommon rules Code review Module structure is followed The module respected the expected structure.\nLicense is compatible A module and its dependencies must be compatible with the OSL (core) and AFL (modules and themes) licenses used to manage and distribute the PrestaShop open source project. Compatible licences are:\n Apache license AFL MIT BSD ISC EUPL  Additionally, distribution licenses like CC-0 or CC-by-sa are appropriate for artwork (e.g: icons, pictures, fonts, but not only)\nCore tables are untouched Module may create all the table they need in the database. However altering core table is forbidden.\nIn case you wanted to add columns for an existing table, the workaround is to create a new table with a foreign key targetting the primary key of the core table.\nOther modules are not altered Modifying core or other modules files is not allowed.\nFile storage in proper directory Module may add / modify some files on the shop. To avoid issues with file permissions, we recommend storing files in the var/%env% directory.\nUse of iFrames is limited to highly secured websites The use of iframes is highly discouraged for security reasons, although they are implemented in different part of the core like in Payment Modules.\n  Using an iframe authorizes to load content from a site that is not controlled by the PrestaShop app. This is the same problem as authorizing to load javascript files from an external source. If the source is being hacked, the attacker could potentially exploit other failures to take control of all the shops that would have installed the module.\n  Therefore we need to check what your processes are, to ensure the security of the content that will be injected by this iframe into all the shops that will install the module. When submitting your module, the validation team will review the reasons why an iFrame is needed for this business and what are the measures taken by the provider to prevent attacks.\n  Module does not rely on external assets The zip you send to PrestaShop Addons must be totally self-sufficient.\nAll the content needed by the module to work properly must be present in the archive. No external content should be downloaded by the module after installation.\nSupport goes though the PrestaShop Marketplace When a module is published on the marketplace, we provide a unique way for all customer to get new updates and to contact the maintainer of the different modules \u0026amp; themes they bought.\nInserting links to an external platform would probably make things easier for a seller, but it would prevent us to help customers and/or seller in case of dispute.\nSQL requests variables are sanitized We examine every SQL request to make sure you did cast your variables. Use (int) for integers and pSQL() for strings.\nMore details:\n Using the DBQuery class Executing your SQL requests  Calls from external services are secured If you have PHP files to handle ajax or external calls, make sure to secure that file. To do so, create a unique token during the module\u0026rsquo;s installation and use it during the call verification.\nMethods with security risks are not used Using serialize() / unserialize() is forbidden, as they are a security risk if you do not control the data going through these methods. They may lead to remote code execution, so we recommend using json_encode() / json_decode() instead.\nThe archive has only one module Module included in another one are difficult to review \u0026amp; can\u0026rsquo;t have their own release process.\nEach module has to be uploaded on the marketplace separately, even if they only work together.\nA file index.php exists in each folder To prevent someone to reach the content of a repository without, a file index.php has to be found in each folder.\nAs we deal with a security risk on some environments, we strongly recommend you comply with this rule. An \u0026ldquo;autoindex\u0026rdquo; tool allows you to add in each folder.\nHTML code is written in templates Use Smarty / Twig templates to display HTML code to respect PrestaShop patterns (MVC architecture) and build a code easy to maintain.\n More details in displaying content.  Code is written in English PrestaShop provides a e-commerce software ready use in many languages. The code and displayed texts are written in English, then translated if the user switches to another language.\nLike for PrestaShop, the code submitted on the marketplace has to be written in English, even if the only user of this code is likely to from only one country or language. A lang unknown by the reviewer would make the validation impossible to do.\nRisk of conflicts between modules is low  Configuration keys  Configuration data is shared between the shop and every module installed. This is convenient if your need to get a value from another part of the shop, but include some risks if two modules stores some data in the same key.\nToo avoid conflicts, configuration keys must be prefixed by the module name. For instance, using a configuration key in the module TheModule would be:\n\u0026lt;?php Configuration::get(\u0026#39;THE_MODULE_PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;); Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;THE_MODULE_PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;, [...]); instead of\n\u0026lt;?php Configuration::get(\u0026#39;PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;); Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;PAYMENT_METHODS_ORDER\u0026#39;, [...]);  Classes  This also applies to classes defined outside a namespace. Having the module name as a prefix will reduce the risk of colision between classes.\nAjax / Cron tasks are secured \u0026amp; in a controller All the AJAX and CRON files must be protected with a unique and secured token to avoid any security issues (outside attacks,\u0026hellip;). Even the front controllers must be secured with a secured token when you use AJAX in it.\nAJAX and CRON scripts must be placed in a controller and not in a separate script to call on its own. For more details:\n Documentation Original issue leading to the use of ModuleFrontControllers  Code in hook is run only when needed Several hooks are called on all pages of the back-office or front-office. When a module is registered on one of them, it may impact the page performance on low-end servers if it runs too much code.\nWe ask to keep the code running in your hooks light, and filter the pages you module runs on if necessary.\nExamples:\n Module filtering the creation of orders from another module  \u0026lt;?php /** * Hook executed at the order confirmation */ public function hookOrderConfirmation($params) { # If created by another module, return.  if ($params[\u0026#39;order\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;module !== $this-\u0026gt;name) { return false; } // [...]  }  Filter for a hook called on all BO pages:  \u0026lt;?php /** * Display content ONLY in the admin payment controller */ public function hookDisplayAdminAfterHeader() { $currentController = $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;controller_name; if (\u0026#39;AdminPayment\u0026#39; !== $currentController) { return false; } // [...]  // return $this-\u0026gt;display(...)  } Debug statements are cleaned All the debug tests have to be removed.\nExample : var_dump($a), dump($a), console.log(‘a’)\u0026hellip;\nCommented code is removed To have a code easier to maintain / review, you must remove the commented lines of code. Code comments are welcome of course!\nCommented code to be removed:\n\u0026lt;?php public function hookPaymentOptions($params) { // if (false === $this-\u0026gt;active) { // \u0026lt;-- never called, to be removed  // return false;  // }  if (false === $this-\u0026gt;merchantIsValid()) { return false; } // if (false === $this-\u0026gt;checkCurrency($params[\u0026#39;cart\u0026#39;])) // {  // return false;  // }  // if (false === $this-\u0026gt;isPaymentStep()) {  // return false;  // }  // [...]  return $payment_options; } Encouraged code comments:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * Add payment option at the checkout in the front office * * @param array $params return by the hook * * @return array|false all payment option available */ public function hookPaymentOptions($params) { // [...]  return $payment_options; } Empty \u0026amp; generated files are removed As they have no consequences in the module execution, empty files can be removed before submission.

PrestaShop will check if this method exists and will only display the \u0026ldquo;Configure\u0026rdquo; button if this method is declared.\nIn the following example we will implement a minimalistic configuration page that displays a form allowing the user to edit the content of the MYMODULE_CONFIG Configuration variable.\nThe getContent() method First, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at our getContent() method:\n/** * This method handles the module\u0026#39;s configuration page * @return string The page\u0026#39;s HTML content */ public function getContent() { $output = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; // this part is executed only when the form is submitted  if (Tools::isSubmit(\u0026#39;submit\u0026#39; . $this-\u0026gt;name)) { // retrieve the value set by the user  $configValue = (string) Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;); // check that the value is valid  if (empty($configValue) || !Validate::isGenericName($configValue)) { // invalid value, show an error  $output = $this-\u0026gt;displayError($this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Invalid Configuration value\u0026#39;)); } else { // value is ok, update it and display a confirmation message  Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;, $configValue); $output = $this-\u0026gt;displayConfirmation($this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Settings updated\u0026#39;)); } } // display any message, then the form  return $output . $this-\u0026gt;displayForm(); } The getContent() method is called when the configuration page is loaded. Therefore, we use it to both display a form and handle the action behind that form.\nHere is a step by step explanation:\n Tools::isSubmit() is a PrestaShop-specific method that checks if a given form has been submitted. In this case, if the configuration form has not yet been sent, the whole if() block is skipped and PrestaShop will only use the last line, which displays the configuration form using current values, as generated by the displayForm() method. Tools::getValue() is another PrestaShop-specific method that retrieves the specified parameter from either POST or GET. In this case, we retrieve the value of the MYMODULE_CONFIG form field, turn its value into a text string using (string), then store it in the $configValue variable. We then check that $configValue is not empty and valid. In this case, we decided that the configuration should not accept special characters, so we use Validate::isGenericName(). The Validate object contains many data validation methods, among which is isGenericName(), a method that helps you keep only strings that are valid PrestaShop names – meaning, a string that does not contain special characters. If any of these checks fail, the configuration will display an error message, indicating that the form validation failed. The $output variable, which contains the final rendition of the HTML code that makes the configuration page, will begin with an error message, that we create using PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s displayError() method. This method returns the correct HTML code for our need, and since that code is first in $output, this means the configuration will be displayed before any other content. If the checks are successful, this means we can store the value in our database. The Configuration::updateValue() method will store the new value for MYMODULE_CONFIG in the configuration database. After that, we want to add a friendly message to the user, indicating that the value has indeed been saved. To that end, we use PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s displayConfirmation() method to add that message as the first data in the $output variable – and therefore, at the top of the page. Finally, we use the custom displayForm() method (explained in the next section) in order to build the form, that we want to render whether if it is submitted or not. Then we will send the resulting HTML code into $output so that we can render the page. Note that we could have included the code for displayForm() right within getContent(), but chose to separate the two for readability and separation of concerns.  This form-validation code is nothing new for PHP developers, but uses some of the PrestaShop methods that you will regularly use.\nDisplaying the form The configuration form itself is displayed with the displayForm() method. Here is its code, which we are going to explain after the jump:\n/** * Builds the configuration form * @return string HTML code */ public function displayForm() { // Init Fields form array  $form = [ \u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;legend\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Settings\u0026#39;), ], \u0026#39;input\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;label\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Configuration value\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 20, \u0026#39;required\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, ], ], \u0026#39;submit\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Save\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;btn btn-default pull-right\u0026#39;, ], ], ]; $helper = new HelperForm(); // Module, token and currentIndex  $helper-\u0026gt;table = $this-\u0026gt;table; $helper-\u0026gt;name_controller = $this-\u0026gt;name; $helper-\u0026gt;token = Tools::getAdminTokenLite(\u0026#39;AdminModules\u0026#39;); $helper-\u0026gt;currentIndex = AdminController::$currentIndex . \u0026#39;\u0026amp;\u0026#39; . http_build_query([\u0026#39;configure\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;name]); $helper-\u0026gt;submit_action = \u0026#39;submit\u0026#39; . $this-\u0026gt;name; // Default language  $helper-\u0026gt;default_form_language = (int) Configuration::get(\u0026#39;PS_LANG_DEFAULT\u0026#39;); // Load current value into the form  $helper-\u0026gt;fields_value[\u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;] = Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;, Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;)); return $helper-\u0026gt;generateForm([$form]); } While this might look like a huge block of code for a single form field, this block actually uses some of PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s methods that make it easier to build forms, most notably the HelperForm object.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s run down this method:\n  In preparation for the generation of the form, we create the $form variable, which contains the definition of the various elements (fields, labels, etc) the form will contain. From this variable, PrestaShop will render the HTML form as it is described.\nIn this example, we define three sections (legend, input and submit) and their properties using arrays. The format is quite straightforward: the legend and submit arrays simply contain the attributes to each tag, while the input array contains as many input elements as needed, each being in turn an array containing the necessary attributes.\nFor instance:\n\u0026#39;input\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;label\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Configuration value\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 20, \u0026#39;required\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, ] ] \u0026hellip;generates the following HTML:\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;form-group\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label class=\u0026#34;control-label col-lg-4 required\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Configuration value\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-log-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;MYMODULE_CONFIG\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; size=\u0026#34;20\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;my friend\u0026#34; required=\u0026#34;required\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; As you can see, PrestaShop is quite clever, and will generate all the code that is needed to obtain a useful form.\n  We then create an instance of the HelperForm class.\n  Once all HelperForm settings have been configured, we generate the form based on the content of the $form variable using generateForm().\n  Understanding HelperForm The HelperForm component enables you to generate standard HTML elements for the back office as well as for module configuration pages.\nOur example uses several of HelperForm\u0026rsquo;s attributes; they need to be set before we can generate the form using the $form variable:\n $helper-\u0026gt;table takes the module\u0026rsquo;s table. $this-\u0026gt;table set to \u0026ldquo;modules\u0026rdquo; by default for all modules. $helper-\u0026gt;name_controller requires the name of the module. $helper-\u0026gt;token is the Back office CSRF token that will be appended to the form\u0026rsquo;s action. getAdminTokenLite() helps us generate one. $helper-\u0026gt;currentIndex expects the URL where the form will be sent to. We use the same URL as the form. $helper-\u0026gt;submit_action is the name of the hidden input sent with the form, which we will later use to tell if the form has been submitted. $helper-\u0026gt;default_form_language requires the shop\u0026rsquo;s default language id, in case we used multi language features. $helper-\u0026gt;fields_value[] is used to fill out the form fields.  The generateForm() method takes care of putting it all together and, as its name says, generates the form that the user will use to configure the module\u0026rsquo;s settings.\nHere is the rendition of the form as it is presently written – which you can see by yourself by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Configure\u0026rdquo; link for the module in the back office:\nChange the value to whichever you like, click on the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button, then go reload the homepage: the form is indeed updated with the new string!\n"

	"content": "Alter configuration forms on modern pages  One of the most common tasks for the PrestaShop developers is to alter the data and make it manageable for customers.

If their ObjectModel (= legacy) equivalent does not exist, the entity is probably only managed by Doctrine.\nIn that case, updating the table can be done by modifying the related entity stored in src/PrestaShopBundle/Entity/.\nDatabase content The default database content is stored in XML files in install/data/xml/. There is one file per entity (= table). XML files are structured following ObjectModel structure.\nThese files are used during the PrestaShop installation as well.\nAnother file is being used to load data during the install process: install/data/db_data.sql. Some versions of PrestaShop do not use it so you might not always find it in the ZIP archive.\nStructure and content upgrades Defining changes Once PrestaShop is installed, the default structure and content files we saw are not used anymore.\nIf a new release of PrestaShop must bring changes to the existing database, an upgrade file must be created along the db_structure.sql update. This SQL file will be stored in the folder /install/upgrade/sql/.\nIts name is the PS version on which the change will be applied.\nFor instance, here is the file 1.7.3.0.sql, used by shops upgrading to 1.7.3.0 or later:\n[...]UPDATE`PREFIX_tab`SET`position`=0WHERE`class_name`=\u0026#39;AdminZones\u0026#39;AND`position`=\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;;UPDATE`PREFIX_tab`SET`position`=1WHERE`class_name`=\u0026#39;AdminCountries\u0026#39;AND`position`=\u0026#39;0\u0026#39;;/* PHP:ps_1730_add_quick_access_evaluation_catalog(); */;/* PHP:ps_1730_move_some_aeuc_configuration_to_core(); */;ALTERTABLE`PREFIX_product`ADD`low_stock_threshold`INT(10)NULLDEFAULTNULLAFTER`minimal_quantity`;[...]In there we can read the SQL queries to execute when upgrading to 1.7.3.0. Each of them alters the structure and/or modify the existing data. In case you have complex algorithms to run, you can call PHP code with the PHP: keyword.\nTo make the code callable, a dedicated file has to be created in /install/upgrade/php/ with a function in it. This file and function must have the same name as we saw in the SQL upgrade file.\nIf we reuse the previous example, we will find the corresponding file /install/upgrade/php/ps_1730_add_quick_access_evaluation_catalog.php:\n\u0026lt;?php function ps_1730_add_quick_access_evaluation_catalog() { // Code inserting values in database  [...] } PrestaShop does not expect these functions to return anything. It will always consider it was run without failure.\nApplying changes Applying the changes on your database can be done:\n by reinstalling the shop from a previous version of PrestaShop, by copying the new files and calling the PHP script install/upgrade/upgrade.php  PrestaShop lists the upgrade files waiting to be applied, by selecting the names fitting between the configuration property PS_VERSION_DB and the constant _PS_INSTALL_VERSION_ defined in install/install_version.php.\nIn the top of this page, we talked about entities being managed only by Doctrine. Applying the changes on the database is done with the following command:\nphp bin/console prestashop:schema:update-without-foreign  Use php app/console instead of php bin/console for versions prior to 1.7.4  "

	"content": "How to extend a grid with Javascript extensions Introduction Javascript grid extensions supplement grid behavior and enhance user experience. For example, most grids contains SortingExtension which provides sorting by columns functionality, BulkActionCheckboxExtension which enables interactive selection of bulk actions and so on. But the fact is that most of grids will not necessarily need all features, so by using extensions we encourage to easily add or remove grid feature while loading only necessary javascript code. In this tutorial we will learn how to use these extensions.\nGetting started To start we will need to have a plain grid already created in php side (you can find more docs about grid in The Grid component page. After following the Grid documentation directions you should now have a fully working php grid. As an example we will use a grid that display taxes items.\n  The twig template should look like this:\n### src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Improve/International/Tax/index.html.twig {% block content %} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;row justify-content-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-lg-12\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {% include \u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/grid_panel.html.twig\u0026#39; with {\u0026#39;grid\u0026#39;: taxGrid} %} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {% endblock %} {% block javascripts %} {{ parent() }} \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ asset(\u0026#39;themes/default/js/bundle/pagination.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {% endblock %}   And this is how it looks in browser:\n   Taxes grid example   Although the grid looks complete, none of the actions are working yet because the javascript behavior is not enabled.\nEnabling javascript   Create javascript file for your page. In our example we create index.js in admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/tax/index.js.\n  Add an entry point in webpack.config.js. In our example we add an entry point in admin-dev/themes/new-theme/.webpack/common.js.\n### admin-dev/themes/new-theme/.webpack/common.js module.exports = { entry: { ### adding taxes page entry point tax: \u0026#39;./js/pages/tax\u0026#39;, }, output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, \u0026#39;../public\u0026#39;), filename: \u0026#39;[name].bundle.js\u0026#39;, },   Add your compiled file path to html script tag in twig template.\n### src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Improve/International/Tax/index.html.twig // ... {% block javascripts %} {{ parent() }} ## Adding script tag with path to compiled js file \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ asset(\u0026#39;themes/new-theme/public/tax.bundle.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ asset(\u0026#39;themes/default/js/bundle/pagination.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {% endblock %}   Adding extensions   Import and initialize Grid component\n### admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/tax/index.js ### 1. import the grid component import Grid from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/grid\u0026#39;; const $ = window.$; $(() =\u0026gt; { ### 2. initialize the grid component by providing grid id const taxGrid = new Grid(\u0026#39;tax\u0026#39;); });   As you can see in example above we are importing Grid component from admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/grid/grid.js (note that the admin-dev part might differ, as it depends on PrestaShop installation).

	"content": "How to extend a grid with Javascript extensions Introduction Javascript grid extensions supplement grid behavior and enhance user experience. For example, most grids contains SortingExtension which provides sorting by columns functionality, BulkActionCheckboxExtension which enables interactive selection of bulk actions and so on. But the fact is that most of grids will not necessarily need all features, so by using extensions we encourage to easily add or remove grid feature while loading only necessary javascript code. In this tutorial we will learn how to use these extensions.\nGetting started To start we will need to have a plain grid already created in php side (you can find more docs about grid in The Grid component page. After following the Grid documentation directions you should now have a fully working php grid. As an example we will use a grid that display taxes items.\n  The twig template should look like this:\n### src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Improve/International/Tax/index.html.twig {% block content %} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;row justify-content-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-lg-12\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {% include \u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/grid_panel.html.twig\u0026#39; with {\u0026#39;grid\u0026#39;: taxGrid} %} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {% endblock %} {% block javascripts %} {{ parent() }} \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ asset(\u0026#39;themes/default/js/bundle/pagination.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {% endblock %}   And this is how it looks in browser:\n   Taxes grid example   Although the grid looks complete, none of the actions are working yet because the javascript behavior is not enabled.\nEnabling javascript   Create javascript file for your page. In our example we create index.js in admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/tax/index.js.\n  Add an entry point in webpack.config.js. In our example we add an entry point in admin-dev/themes/new-theme/.webpack/common.js.\n### admin-dev/themes/new-theme/.webpack/common.js module.exports = { entry: { ### adding taxes page entry point tax: \u0026#39;./js/pages/tax\u0026#39;, }, output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, \u0026#39;../public\u0026#39;), filename: \u0026#39;[name].bundle.js\u0026#39;, },   Add your compiled file path to html script tag in twig template.\n### src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Improve/International/Tax/index.html.twig // ... {% block javascripts %} {{ parent() }} ## Adding script tag with path to compiled js file \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ asset(\u0026#39;themes/new-theme/public/tax.bundle.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ asset(\u0026#39;themes/default/js/bundle/pagination.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {% endblock %}   Adding extensions   Import and initialize Grid component\n### admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/tax/index.js ### 1. import the grid component import Grid from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/grid\u0026#39;; const $ = window.$; $(() =\u0026gt; { ### 2. initialize the grid component by providing grid id const taxGrid = new Grid(\u0026#39;tax\u0026#39;); });   As you can see in example above we are importing Grid component from admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/grid/grid.js (note that the admin-dev part might differ, as it depends on PrestaShop installation). Next - initiating the grid component by declaring const taxGrid = new Grid('tax');. In this case the argument 'tax' represents the id of our grid.\nThe id provided to Grid component must be the same as in TaxGridDefinitionFactory.php\nNow when you need specific extension, just import it from admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/components/grid/extension and add it to your grid - taxGrid.addExtension(new SortingExtension());. In case you need more than one list per page, you can just declare another variable of another list and add extensions the same way.\n### admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/tax/index.js import Grid from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/grid\u0026#39;; ### import extension import SortingExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/sorting-extension\u0026#39;; const $ = window.$; $(() =\u0026gt; { const taxGrid = new Grid(\u0026#39;tax\u0026#39;); ### add extension to grid taxGrid.addExtension(new SortingExtension()); }); After adding all needed extensions, our index.js should look like this:\n### admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/tax/index.js import Grid from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/grid\u0026#39;; import SortingExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/sorting-extension\u0026#39;; import FiltersResetExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/filters-reset-extension\u0026#39;; import ReloadListActionExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/reload-list-extension\u0026#39;; import ColumnTogglingExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/column-toggling-extension\u0026#39;; import SubmitRowActionExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/action/row/submit-row-action-extension\u0026#39;; import SubmitBulkExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/submit-bulk-action-extension\u0026#39;; import BulkActionCheckboxExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/bulk-action-checkbox-extension\u0026#39;; import ExportToSqlManagerExtension from \u0026#39;../../components/grid/extension/export-to-sql-manager-extension\u0026#39;; const $ = window.$; $(() =\u0026gt; { const taxGrid = new Grid(\u0026#39;tax\u0026#39;); taxGrid.addExtension(new ExportToSqlManagerExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new ReloadListActionExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new SortingExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new FiltersResetExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new ColumnTogglingExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new SubmitRowActionExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new SubmitBulkExtension()); taxGrid.addExtension(new BulkActionCheckboxExtension()); }); The last thing to do is to run the compiler. [More about compiler and npm commands here]({{ relref \u0026ldquo;/8/development/compile-assets\u0026rdquo; }}).\nIn our example we open command line, cd to {{Our prestashop root directory}}/admin-dev/themes/new-theme and type the following command:\n npm run build (for production)  OR\n npm run dev (for development)  Wait until compiling finishes and test the grid.

Even though modules are no longer allowed to override a complete controller like before (it was highly discouraged anyway), we have introduced new powerful and more efficient ways to customize the Back Office.\nAs part of this migration, PrestaShop is switching its templating engine from Smarty to Twig. Twig is very popular in the PHP/Symfony world, it\u0026rsquo;s well-documented and it\u0026rsquo;s also one of the most efficient engines out there.\nThis means that once all the pages have been migrated, the whole Back Office will be Twig-based. This engine has allowed us to enable some powerful new features for module developers on modern pages.\nOverride templates Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to improve the Product Listing page of the back office.\nOur Customer want a better Listing view: the \u0026ldquo;Price\u0026rdquo; column should be at position 2 and the \u0026ldquo;Reference\u0026rdquo; column to be removed.

A default store loads a lot less files in 1.7 compared to 1.6, there are no specific files per page for instance. The 2 new important files you have to master are:\n   File Content     core.js Loads jQuery3, makes ajax calls, defines core methods that all frontend should use   theme.js Bundles all theme specific code and libraries    jQuery is loaded by the core, so each theme will have jQuery v2 available. Do not redefine it. Events Dispatch an event The best way to trigger an event is to use the prestashop object. Here is a simple example:\nprestashop.emit( \u0026#39;myEventName\u0026#39;, { myData1: 1, myData2: 3 } ); Listening to events You can also react to an event emitted by prestashop.emit. Here is a simple example:\nif (typeof prestashop !== \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39;) { prestashop.on( \u0026#39;myEventName\u0026#39;, function (event) { var eventDatas = {}; if (event \u0026amp;\u0026amp; event.reason) { eventDatas = { my_data_1: event.reason.myData1, my_data_2: event.reason.myData2 }; } } ); } Dispatched events PrestaShop will dispatch many events from core.js so your code can rely on it:\n   Event Name Description     updateCart On the cart page, everytime something happens (change quantity, remove product and so on) the cart is reloaded by ajax call. After the cart is updated, this event is triggered.   updatedAddressForm In the address form, some input will trigger ajax calls to modify the form (like country change), after the form is updated, this event is triggered.   updateDeliveryForm During checkout, if the delivery address is modified, this event will be trigged.   changedCheckoutStep Each checkout step submission will fire this event.   updateProductList On every product list page (category, search results, pricedrop and so on), the list is updated via ajax calls if you change filters or sorting options. Each time the DOM is reloaded with new product list, this event is triggered.   clickQuickView If your theme handles it, this event will be trigged when you click on the quickview link.   updateProduct On the product page, selecting a new combination will reload the DOM via ajax calls. After the update, this event is fired.   updatedProduct On the product page, selecting a new combination will reload the DOM via ajax calls. After the update, this event is fired.   handleError This event is fired after a fail of POST request. Have the eventType as first parameter.   updateFacets On every product list page (category, search results, pricedrop and so on), the list is updated via ajax calls if you change filters or sorting options. Each time the facets is reloaded, this event is triggered.   responsive update While browser is resized, this event is fired with a mobile parameter.    Triggering delegated events We use event delegation to make sure that the events are still attached after the DOM was modified (like after an ajax call).\nHere is a simple way to trigger a delegated event.\nconst body = $(\u0026#39;body\u0026#39;); // Our events are usually attached to the body  const event = jQuery.Event(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;); event.target = body.find(\u0026#39;.js-theClassYouNeed\u0026#39;); body.trigger(event); "

	"content": "Displaying content on the front office As it is, the module does not do much. In order to display something on the front office, we have to add support for a few hooks. This is done by implementing the hooks' methods, and that was actually done in the install() method we wrote earlier, using the registerHook() method:\n\u0026lt;?php public function install() { if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) { Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); } return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;leftColumn\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionFrontControllerSetMedia\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;my friend\u0026#39;); } As you can see, we make it so that the module is hooked to the \u0026ldquo;leftColumn\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;actionFrontControllerSetMedia\u0026rdquo; hooks. In addition to this, we will add code for the \u0026ldquo;rightColumn\u0026rdquo; hook.\nAttaching code to a hook requires a specific method for each:\n hookDisplayLeftColumn(): will hook code into the left column – in our case, it will fetch the MYMODULE_NAME module setting and display the module\u0026rsquo;s template file, mymodule.tpl, which must be located in the /views/templates/hook/ folder. hookDisplayRightColumn(): will simply do the same as hookDisplayLeftColumn(), but for the right column. hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia(): will add a link to the module\u0026rsquo;s CSS file, /views/css/mymodule.css and module\u0026rsquo;s JS file, /views/js/mymodule.js.  \u0026lt;?php public function hookDisplayLeftColumn($params) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;assign([ \u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;my_module_link\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;link-\u0026gt;getModuleLink(\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;display\u0026#39;) ]); return $this-\u0026gt;display(__FILE__, \u0026#39;mymodule.tpl\u0026#39;); } public function hookDisplayRightColumn($params) { return $this-\u0026gt;hookDisplayLeftColumn($params); } public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia() { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerStylesheet( \u0026#39;mymodule-style\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;_path.\u0026#39;views/css/mymodule.css\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;media\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;all\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1000, ] ); $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerJavascript( \u0026#39;mymodule-javascript\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;_path.\u0026#39;views/js/mymodule.js\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;position\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;bottom\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1000, ] ); } We are using the Context ($this-\u0026gt;context) to change a Smarty variable: Smarty\u0026rsquo;s assign() method makes it possible for us to set the template\u0026rsquo;s name variable with the value of the MYMODULE_NAME setting stored in the configuration database table.\nThe actionFrontControllerSetMedia hook is not part of the visual header, but enables us to put assets after code in the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag of the generated HTML file. This is very useful for JavaScript or CSS files. To add a link to our CSS file in the page\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag, we use the registerStylesheet() method, which generates the correct \u0026lt;link\u0026gt; tag to the CSS file indicated in parameters. To add our JS script in the page, we use the registerJavascript() method, which generates the correct \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag.\nSave your file, and already you can hook your module\u0026rsquo;s template into the theme, move it around and transplant it (even though there is not template file for the moment): go to the \u0026ldquo;Positions\u0026rdquo; page from the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; menu in the back office, then click on the \u0026ldquo;Transplant a module\u0026rdquo; button (top right of the page).\nIn the transplantation form:\n Find \u0026ldquo;My module\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Module\u0026rdquo; drop-down list. Choose \u0026ldquo;(displayLeftColumn) Left column blocks\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Hook into\u0026rdquo; drop-down list. Click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.  It is useless to try to attach a module to a hook for which it has no implemented method.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Positions\u0026rdquo; page should reload, with the following message: \u0026ldquo;Module transplanted successfully to hook\u0026rdquo; (or maybe \u0026ldquo;This module has already been transplanted to this hook. \u0026ldquo;). Congratulations! Scroll down the \u0026ldquo;Positions\u0026rdquo; page, and you should indeed see your module among the other modules in the \u0026ldquo;Left column blocks\u0026rdquo; list. Move it to the top of the list by drag\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;dropping the module\u0026rsquo;s row.\nThe module is now attached to the left column\u0026hellip; but without any template to display, it falls short of doing anything useful: if you reload the homepage, the left column simply displays a message where the module should be, saying \u0026ldquo;No template found for module mymodule\u0026rdquo;.\nDisplaying content Now that we have access to the left column, we should display something there for the customer to see.\nThe visible part of the module is defined in .tpl files placed in specific View folders:\n /views/templates/front/: front office features. /views/templates/admin/: back office features. /views/templates/hook/: features hooked to a PrestaShop (so can be displayed either on the front office or the back office).  Template files can have just about any name. It there is only one such file, it is good practice to give it the same name as the folder and main file: mymodule.tpl.\nIn the case of this tutorial, the module will be hooked to the left column. Therefore, the TPL files that are called from the column\u0026rsquo;s hook should be placed in /views/templates/hook/ in order to work properly.\nAs said earlier, the content to be displayed in the theme should be stored in .tpl template files placed in a specific folder: /views/templates/front/. Template files can have just about any name. It there is only one such file, it is good practice to give it the same name as the folder and main file: mymodule.tpl.\nWe will create the mymodule.tpl file, which was passed as a parameter of the display() method in our module\u0026rsquo;s code, in the hookDisplayHome() method. When calling a template from within a hook, PrestaShop looks for that template file in the /views/templates/hook/ folder (in the module\u0026rsquo;s folder), which you must create yourself.\nIn PrestaShop 1.4, the module\u0026rsquo;s template files were to be placed at the root of the module\u0026rsquo;s folder.\nFor compatibility reasons, template files can still reside in the root folder in PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6, although the sub-folders of /views/templates/ are now the recommended locations. If you intend your module to also work in PrestaShop 1.4, you should keep your files at the root.\nHere is our template file, located at /views/templates/hook/mymodule.tpl:\n\u0026lt;!-- Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;mymodule_block_home\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;block\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;block_content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello, {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} World {/if} ! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$my_module_link}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Click this link\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /Block mymodule --\u0026gt; This is just regular HTML code\u0026hellip; except for a few Smarty calls:\n The {l s='xxx' mod='yyy'} call is PrestaShop-specific method that enables you to register the string in the module\u0026rsquo;s translation panel. The s parameter is the string, while the mod parameter must contain the module\u0026rsquo;s identifier (in the present case, \u0026ldquo;mymodule\u0026rdquo;). We only use this method once here for readability reasons, but in practice it should be used on all of the template\u0026rsquo;s strings. The {if}, {else} and {/if} statements are Smarty conditionals. In our example, we check that the $my_module_name Smarty variable exists (using PHP\u0026rsquo;s isset() function, which considered as trusted by Smarty) and that it is not empty. If it goes well, we display the content of that variable; if not, we display \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo;, in order to have \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo;. The {$my_module_link} variable in the link\u0026rsquo;s href attribute: this is a Smarty variable that we will create later on, which will point to PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s root directory.  In addition to that, we are going to create a CSS file, and save it as /views/css/mymodule.css in the module\u0026rsquo;s folder (or any sub-folder you like to keep you CSS in):\ndiv#mymodule_block_home p { font-size: 150%; font-style:italic; } Save the template file in the module\u0026rsquo;s /views/templates/hook/ folder and the CSS file in the module\u0026rsquo;s /views/css/ folder, reload your shop\u0026rsquo;s homepage: the content of the template should appear on top of the left column, right below the shop\u0026rsquo;s logo (if you have indeed moved it at the top of the \u0026ldquo;Left Column\u0026rdquo; hook during the transplanting part).\nAs you can see, the theme applies its own CSS to the template we added:\n Our \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt; title becomes the block\u0026rsquo;s header, styled the same way as the other block titles. Our \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;block_content\u0026quot;\u0026gt; block has the same style as the other blocks on the page.  It is not pretty, but it works the way we want it to.\nDisabling the cache If you\u0026rsquo;ve followed this tutorial to the letter and still do not see anything appearing in the theme\u0026rsquo;s left column, it might be because PrestaShop has cached the previous templates, and is still serving these to you. Hence, you see the original version of the theme, without your changes.\nSmarty caches a compiled version of the homepage, for performance reasons. This is immensely helpful for production sites, but is useless for tests sites, where you may load the front-page very regularly in order to see the impact of your changes.\nWhen editing or debugging a theme on a test site, you should always disable the cache, in order to force Smarty to recompile templates on every page load. To that end, go to the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Parameters\u0026rdquo; menu, select the \u0026ldquo;Performance\u0026rdquo; page, then, in the \u0026ldquo;Smarty\u0026rdquo; section:\n Template cache. Choose \u0026ldquo;Disable the cache\u0026rdquo;. Cache. Disable it. Debug console. You can also open the console if you want to learn more about Smarty\u0026rsquo;s internals.  Do NOT disable the cache or enable the debug console on a production site, as it severely slows everything down! You should always perform all your tests in a test site, ideally on your own computer rather than online.\nIf you still can\u0026rsquo;t see the changes you made, you might have forgotten to register actionFrontControllerSetMedia hook.\nEmbedding a template in the theme The link that the module displays does not lead anywhere for now. Let\u0026rsquo;s create the display.php file that it targets, with a minimal content, and put it in: modules/yourmodule/controllers/front/.\nWelcome to this page! Click the \u0026ldquo;Click me!\u0026rdquo; link: the resulting page is just that raw text, without anything from the theme. We would like to have this text embedded in the theme, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how to do just that.\nAs you would expect, we have to create a template file in order to use the theme\u0026rsquo;s style. Let\u0026rsquo;s create the display.tpl file, which will contain the basic \u0026ldquo;Welcome to my shop!\u0026rdquo; line, and will be called by display.php. That display.php file will be rewritten into a front-end controller in order to properly embed our basic template within the theme\u0026rsquo;s header, footer, columns, etc.\nNOTE: You should strive to use explicit and recognizable names for your template files, so that you can find them quickly in the back office – which is a must when using the translation tool.\nHere are our two files:\n display.php  \u0026lt;?php class mymoduledisplayModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function initContent() { parent::initContent(); $this-\u0026gt;setTemplate(\u0026#39;module:mymodule/views/templates/front/display.tpl\u0026#39;); } }  display.tpl  Welcome to my shop! Let\u0026rsquo;s explore display.php, our first PrestaShop front-end controller, stored in the /controllers/front folder of the module\u0026rsquo;s main folder.\nA front-end controller must be a class that extends the ModuleFrontController class. That controller must have one method: initContent(), which calls the parent class' initContent() method\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;which then calls the setTemplate() method with our display.tpl file.\nsetTemplate() is the method that will take care of embedding our one-line template into a full-blown page, with proper header, footer and sidebars.\nUntil PrestaShop 1.4, developers who wanted to embed a template file into the site\u0026rsquo;s theme had to use PHP\u0026rsquo;s include() calls to include each portion of the page. Here is the equivalent code for display.php:\n// This file must be placed at the root of the module\u0026#39;s folder. global $smarty; include(\u0026#39;../../config/config.inc.php\u0026#39;); include(\u0026#39;../../header.php\u0026#39;); $smarty-\u0026gt;display(dirname(__FILE__).\u0026#39;/display.tpl\u0026#39;); include(\u0026#39;../../footer.php\u0026#39;); As you can see, this is not necessary anymore since PrestaShop 1.5: you can and should use a front-end controller, and both the controller (Controller) and its template (View) should share the same name: display.php is tied to display.tpl.\nSave both files in their respective folders, and reload your shop\u0026rsquo;s homepage, then click on the \u0026ldquo;Click me!\u0026rdquo;, and voilà ! You have your link. With just a few lines, the end result is already much better, with the \u0026ldquo;Welcome\u0026rdquo; line neatly placed between header, footer and columns!\nIt is only a first step, but this gives you an idea of what is possible if you follow the templating rules. Using Smarty\nSmarty is a PHP template engine, and is used by PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s theming system. It is a free and open-source projet, hosted at https://www.smarty.net/.\nIt parses template .tpl files, looking for dynamic elements to replace with their contextual equivalents, then send the generated result to the browser. Those dynamic elements are indicated with curly brackets: { ... }. Programmers can create new variables and use them in TPL files; PrestaShop adds its own set of variables.\nFor instance, we can create the $my_module_message variable in PHP right in the hookDisplayLeftColumn() method, and have it displayed by our template file:\n mymodule.php  \u0026lt;?php public function hookDisplayLeftColumn($params) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;assign( [ \u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;my_module_link\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;link-\u0026gt;getModuleLink(\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;display\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;my_module_message\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;This is a simple text message\u0026#39;) // Do not forget to enclose your strings in the l() translation method  ] ); return $this-\u0026gt;display(__FILE__, \u0026#39;mymodule.tpl\u0026#39;); } From there on, we can ask Smarty to display the content of this variable in our TPL file.\n mymodule.tpl  {$my_module_message} PrestaShop adds its own set of variables. For instance, {$hook_left_column} will be replaced with the content for the left column, meaning the content from all the modules that have been attached to the left column\u0026rsquo;s hook.\nAll Smarty variables are global. You should therefore pay attention not to name your own variable with the name of an existing Smarty variable, in order to avoid overwriting it. It is good practice to avoid overly simple names, such as {$products}, and to prefix it with your module\u0026rsquo;s name, or even your own name or initials, such as: {$henryb_mymodule_products}.\nHere is a list of Smarty variables that are common to all template pages:\n   File / folder Description     $urls.base_url Site URL.   $urls.current_url Current page URL.   $urls.shop_domain_url Shop URL.   $urls.img_ps_url URL for PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s image folder.   $urls.img_cat_url URL for the categories images folder.   $urls.img_lang_url URL for the languages images folder.   $urls.img_prod_url URL for the products images folder.   $urls.img_manu_url URL for the manufacturers images folder.   $urls.img_sup_url URL for the suppliers images folder.   $urls.img_ship_url URL for the carriers (shipping) images folder.   $urls.img_url URL for the theme\u0026rsquo;s images folder.   $urls.css_url URL for the theme\u0026rsquo;s CSS folder.   $urls.js_url URL for the theme\u0026rsquo;s JavaScript folder.   $module_template_dir URL for the current theme\u0026rsquo;s folder.   $module_dir URL the modules folder.   mail_dir (deprecated) URL for the mail templates folder.   $urls.pic_url URL for the pictures upload folder.   $language.iso_code ISO code for the current language.   come_from (deprecated) URL for the visitor\u0026rsquo;s origin.   $shop.name Shop name.   cart_qties (deprecated) Number of products in the cart.   $cart The cart.   currencies (deprecated) The various available currencies.   id_currency_cookie (deprecated) ID of the current currency.   $currency Currency object (currently used currency).   cookie (deprecated) User cookie.   $language The various available languages.   $customer.is_logged Indicates whether the visitor is logged to a customer account.   $page.page_name Page name.   $customer.firstname Client firstname (if logged in).   $customer.lastname Client lastname (if logged in).   priceDisplay (deprecated) Price display method (with or without taxes\u0026hellip;).   roundMode (deprecated) Rounding method in use.   use_taxes (deprecated) Indicates whether taxes are enabled or not.    There are many other contextual hooks. If you need to display all of the current page\u0026rsquo;s Smarty variables, add the following call:\n{debug} If you need to display a variable, add the following call:\n{dump($variableName)} Comments are based on asterisk:\n{* This string is commented out *} {* This string is too! *} Unlike with HTML comments, commented-out Smarty code is not present in the final output file.\n"

	"content": "Displaying content on the front office As it is, the module does not do much. In order to display something on the front office, we have to add support for a few hooks. This is done by implementing the hooks' methods, and that was actually done in the install() method we wrote earlier, using the registerHook() method:\n\u0026lt;?php public function install() { if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) { Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); } return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;leftColumn\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionFrontControllerSetMedia\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;my friend\u0026#39;); } As you can see, we make it so that the module is hooked to the \u0026ldquo;leftColumn\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;actionFrontControllerSetMedia\u0026rdquo; hooks. In addition to this, we will add code for the \u0026ldquo;rightColumn\u0026rdquo; hook.\nAttaching code to a hook requires a specific method for each:\n hookDisplayLeftColumn(): will hook code into the left column – in our case, it will fetch the MYMODULE_NAME module setting and display the module\u0026rsquo;s template file, mymodule.tpl, which must be located in the /views/templates/hook/ folder. hookDisplayRightColumn(): will simply do the same as hookDisplayLeftColumn(), but for the right column. hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia(): will add a link to the module\u0026rsquo;s CSS file, /views/css/mymodule.css and module\u0026rsquo;s JS file, /views/js/mymodule.js.  \u0026lt;?php public function hookDisplayLeftColumn($params) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;assign([ \u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;my_module_link\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;link-\u0026gt;getModuleLink(\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;display\u0026#39;) ]); return $this-\u0026gt;display(__FILE__, \u0026#39;mymodule.tpl\u0026#39;); } public function hookDisplayRightColumn($params) { return $this-\u0026gt;hookDisplayLeftColumn($params); } public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia() { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerStylesheet( \u0026#39;mymodule-style\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;_path.\u0026#39;views/css/mymodule.css\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;media\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;all\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1000, ] ); $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerJavascript( \u0026#39;mymodule-javascript\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;_path.\u0026#39;views/js/mymodule.js\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;position\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;bottom\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1000, ] ); } We are using the Context ($this-\u0026gt;context) to change a Smarty variable: Smarty\u0026rsquo;s assign() method makes it possible for us to set the template\u0026rsquo;s name variable with the value of the MYMODULE_NAME setting stored in the configuration database table.\nThe actionFrontControllerSetMedia hook is not part of the visual header, but enables us to put assets after code in the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag of the generated HTML file. This is very useful for JavaScript or CSS files. To add a link to our CSS file in the page\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag, we use the registerStylesheet() method, which generates the correct \u0026lt;link\u0026gt; tag to the CSS file indicated in parameters. To add our JS script in the page, we use the registerJavascript() method, which generates the correct \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag.\nSave your file, and already you can hook your module\u0026rsquo;s template into the theme, move it around and transplant it (even though there is not template file for the moment): go to the \u0026ldquo;Positions\u0026rdquo; page from the \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; menu in the back office, then click on the \u0026ldquo;Transplant a module\u0026rdquo; button (top right of the page).\nIn the transplantation form:\n Find \u0026ldquo;My module\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Module\u0026rdquo; drop-down list. Choose \u0026ldquo;(displayLeftColumn) Left column blocks\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Hook into\u0026rdquo; drop-down list. Click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.  It is useless to try to attach a module to a hook for which it has no implemented method.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Positions\u0026rdquo; page should reload, with the following message: \u0026ldquo;Module transplanted successfully to hook\u0026rdquo; (or maybe \u0026ldquo;This module has already been transplanted to this hook. \u0026ldquo;). Congratulations! Scroll down the \u0026ldquo;Positions\u0026rdquo; page, and you should indeed see your module among the other modules in the \u0026ldquo;Left column blocks\u0026rdquo; list. Move it to the top of the list by drag\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;dropping the module\u0026rsquo;s row.\nThe module is now attached to the left column\u0026hellip; but without any template to display, it falls short of doing anything useful: if you reload the homepage, the left column simply displays a message where the module should be, saying \u0026ldquo;No template found for module mymodule\u0026rdquo;.\nDisplaying content Now that we have access to the left column, we should display something there for the customer to see.\nThe visible part of the module is defined in .tpl files placed in specific View folders:\n /views/templates/front/: front office features. /views/templates/admin/: back office features. /views/templates/hook/: features hooked to a PrestaShop (so can be displayed either on the front office or the back office).  Template files can have just about any name. It there is only one such file, it is good practice to give it the same name as the folder and main file: mymodule.tpl.\nIn the case of this tutorial, the module will be hooked to the left column. Therefore, the TPL files that are called from the column\u0026rsquo;s hook should be placed in /views/templates/hook/ in order to work properly.\nAs said earlier, the content to be displayed in the theme should be stored in .tpl template files placed in a specific folder: /views/templates/front/. Template files can have just about any name. It there is only one such file, it is good practice to give it the same name as the folder and main file: mymodule.tpl.\nWe will create the mymodule.tpl file, which was passed as a parameter of the display() method in our module\u0026rsquo;s code, in the hookDisplayHome() method. When calling a template from within a hook, PrestaShop looks for that template file in the /views/templates/hook/ folder (in the module\u0026rsquo;s folder), which you must create yourself.\nIn PrestaShop 1.4, the module\u0026rsquo;s template files were to be placed at the root of the module\u0026rsquo;s folder.\nFor compatibility reasons, template files can still reside in the root folder in PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6, although the sub-folders of /views/templates/ are now the recommended locations. If you intend your module to also work in PrestaShop 1.4, you should keep your files at the root.\nHere is our template file, located at /views/templates/hook/mymodule.tpl:\n\u0026lt;!-- Block mymodule --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;mymodule_block_home\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;block\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{l s=\u0026#39;Welcome!\u0026#39; mod=\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;block_content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello, {if isset($my_module_name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $my_module_name} {$my_module_name} {else} World {/if} ! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$my_module_link}\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Click this link\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me!\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- /Block mymodule --\u0026gt; This is just regular HTML code\u0026hellip; except for a few Smarty calls:\n The {l s='xxx' mod='yyy'} call is PrestaShop-specific method that enables you to register the string in the module\u0026rsquo;s translation panel. The s parameter is the string, while the mod parameter must contain the module\u0026rsquo;s identifier (in the present case, \u0026ldquo;mymodule\u0026rdquo;). We only use this method once here for readability reasons, but in practice it should be used on all of the template\u0026rsquo;s strings. The {if}, {else} and {/if} statements are Smarty conditionals. In our example, we check that the $my_module_name Smarty variable exists (using PHP\u0026rsquo;s isset() function, which considered as trusted by Smarty) and that it is not empty. If it goes well, we display the content of that variable; if not, we display \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rdquo;, in order to have \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo;. The {$my_module_link} variable in the link\u0026rsquo;s href attribute: this is a Smarty variable that we will create later on, which will point to PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s root directory.  In addition to that, we are going to create a CSS file, and save it as /views/css/mymodule.css in the module\u0026rsquo;s folder (or any sub-folder you like to keep you CSS in):\ndiv#mymodule_block_home p { font-size: 150%; font-style:italic; } Save the template file in the module\u0026rsquo;s /views/templates/hook/ folder and the CSS file in the module\u0026rsquo;s /views/css/ folder, reload your shop\u0026rsquo;s homepage: the content of the template should appear on top of the left column, right below the shop\u0026rsquo;s logo (if you have indeed moved it at the top of the \u0026ldquo;Left Column\u0026rdquo; hook during the transplanting part).\nAs you can see, the theme applies its own CSS to the template we added:\n Our \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt; title becomes the block\u0026rsquo;s header, styled the same way as the other block titles. Our \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;block_content\u0026quot;\u0026gt; block has the same style as the other blocks on the page.  It is not pretty, but it works the way we want it to.\nDisabling the cache If you\u0026rsquo;ve followed this tutorial to the letter and still do not see anything appearing in the theme\u0026rsquo;s left column, it might be because PrestaShop has cached the previous templates, and is still serving these to you. Hence, you see the original version of the theme, without your changes.\nSmarty caches a compiled version of the homepage, for performance reasons. This is immensely helpful for production sites, but is useless for tests sites, where you may load the front-page very regularly in order to see the impact of your changes.\nWhen editing or debugging a theme on a test site, you should always disable the cache, in order to force Smarty to recompile templates on every page load. To that end, go to the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Parameters\u0026rdquo; menu, select the \u0026ldquo;Performance\u0026rdquo; page, then, in the \u0026ldquo;Smarty\u0026rdquo; section:\n Template cache. Choose \u0026ldquo;Disable the cache\u0026rdquo;. Cache. Disable it. Debug console. You can also open the console if you want to learn more about Smarty\u0026rsquo;s internals.  Do NOT disable the cache or enable the debug console on a production site, as it severely slows everything down! You should always perform all your tests in a test site, ideally on your own computer rather than online.\nIf you still can\u0026rsquo;t see the changes you made, you might have forgotten to register actionFrontControllerSetMedia hook.\nEmbedding a template in the theme The link that the module displays does not lead anywhere for now. Let\u0026rsquo;s create the display.php file that it targets, with a minimal content, and put it in: modules/yourmodule/controllers/front/.\nWelcome to this page! Click the \u0026ldquo;Click me!\u0026rdquo; link: the resulting page is just that raw text, without anything from the theme. We would like to have this text embedded in the theme, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how to do just that.\nAs you would expect, we have to create a template file in order to use the theme\u0026rsquo;s style. Let\u0026rsquo;s create the display.tpl file, which will contain the basic \u0026ldquo;Welcome to my shop!\u0026rdquo; line, and will be called by display.php. That display.php file will be rewritten into a front-end controller in order to properly embed our basic template within the theme\u0026rsquo;s header, footer, columns, etc.\nNOTE: You should strive to use explicit and recognizable names for your template files, so that you can find them quickly in the back office – which is a must when using the translation tool.\nHere are our two files:\n display.php  \u0026lt;?php class mymoduledisplayModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function initContent() { parent::initContent(); $this-\u0026gt;setTemplate(\u0026#39;module:mymodule/views/templates/front/display.tpl\u0026#39;); } }  display.tpl  Welcome to my shop! Let\u0026rsquo;s explore display.php, our first PrestaShop front-end controller, stored in the /controllers/front folder of the module\u0026rsquo;s main folder.\nA front-end controller must be a class that extends the ModuleFrontController class. That controller must have one method: initContent(), which calls the parent class' initContent() method\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;which then calls the setTemplate() method with our display.tpl file.\nsetTemplate() is the method that will take care of embedding our one-line template into a full-blown page, with proper header, footer and sidebars.\nUntil PrestaShop 1.4, developers who wanted to embed a template file into the site\u0026rsquo;s theme had to use PHP\u0026rsquo;s include() calls to include each portion of the page. Here is the equivalent code for display.php:\n// This file must be placed at the root of the module\u0026#39;s folder. global $smarty; include(\u0026#39;../../config/config.inc.php\u0026#39;); include(\u0026#39;../../header.php\u0026#39;); $smarty-\u0026gt;display(dirname(__FILE__).\u0026#39;/display.tpl\u0026#39;); include(\u0026#39;../../footer.php\u0026#39;); As you can see, this is not necessary anymore since PrestaShop 1.5: you can and should use a front-end controller, and both the controller (Controller) and its template (View) should share the same name: display.php is tied to display.tpl.\nSave both files in their respective folders, and reload your shop\u0026rsquo;s homepage, then click on the \u0026ldquo;Click me!\u0026rdquo;, and voilà ! You have your link. With just a few lines, the end result is already much better, with the \u0026ldquo;Welcome\u0026rdquo; line neatly placed between header, footer and columns!\nIt is only a first step, but this gives you an idea of what is possible if you follow the templating rules. Using Smarty\nSmarty is a PHP template engine, and is used by PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s theming system. It is a free and open-source projet, hosted at https://www.smarty.net/.\nIt parses template .tpl files, looking for dynamic elements to replace with their contextual equivalents, then send the generated result to the browser. Those dynamic elements are indicated with curly brackets: { ... }. Programmers can create new variables and use them in TPL files; PrestaShop adds its own set of variables.\nFor instance, we can create the $my_module_message variable in PHP right in the hookDisplayLeftColumn() method, and have it displayed by our template file:\n mymodule.php  \u0026lt;?php public function hookDisplayLeftColumn($params) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;assign( [ \u0026#39;my_module_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYMODULE_NAME\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;my_module_link\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;link-\u0026gt;getModuleLink(\u0026#39;mymodule\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;display\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;my_module_message\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;This is a simple text message\u0026#39;) // Do not forget to enclose your strings in the l() translation method  ] ); return $this-\u0026gt;display(__FILE__, \u0026#39;mymodule.tpl\u0026#39;); } From there on, we can ask Smarty to display the content of this variable in our TPL file.\n mymodule.tpl  {$my_module_message} PrestaShop adds its own set of variables. For instance, {$hook_left_column} will be replaced with the content for the left column, meaning the content from all the modules that have been attached to the left column\u0026rsquo;s hook.\nAll Smarty variables are global. You should therefore pay attention not to name your own variable with the name of an existing Smarty variable, in order to avoid overwriting it. It is good practice to avoid overly simple names, such as {$products}, and to prefix it with your module\u0026rsquo;s name, or even your own name or initials, such as: {$henryb_mymodule_products}.\nHere is a list of Smarty variables that are common to all template pages:\n   File / folder Description     $urls.base_url Site URL.   $urls.current_url Current page URL.   $urls.shop_domain_url Shop URL.   $urls.img_ps_url URL for PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s image folder.   $urls.img_cat_url URL for the categories images folder.   $urls.img_lang_url URL for the languages images folder.   $urls.img_prod_url URL for the products images folder.   $urls.img_manu_url URL for the manufacturers images folder.   $urls.img_sup_url URL for the suppliers images folder.   $urls.img_ship_url URL for the carriers (shipping) images folder.   $urls.img_url URL for the theme\u0026rsquo;s images folder.   $urls.css_url URL for the theme\u0026rsquo;s CSS folder.   $urls.js_url URL for the theme\u0026rsquo;s JavaScript folder.   $module_template_dir URL for the current theme\u0026rsquo;s folder.   $module_dir URL the modules folder.   mail_dir (deprecated) URL for the mail templates folder.   $urls.pic_url URL for the pictures upload folder.   $language.iso_code ISO code for the current language.   come_from (deprecated) URL for the visitor\u0026rsquo;s origin.   $shop.name Shop name.   cart_qties (deprecated) Number of products in the cart.   $cart The cart.   currencies (deprecated) The various available currencies.   id_currency_cookie (deprecated) ID of the current currency.   $currency Currency object (currently used currency).   cookie (deprecated) User cookie.   $language The various available languages.   $customer.is_logged Indicates whether the visitor is logged to a customer account.   $page.page_name Page name.   $customer.firstname Client firstname (if logged in).   $customer.lastname Client lastname (if logged in).   priceDisplay (deprecated) Price display method (with or without taxes\u0026hellip;).   roundMode (deprecated) Rounding method in use.   use_taxes (deprecated) Indicates whether taxes are enabled or not.    There are many other contextual hooks. If you need to display all of the current page\u0026rsquo;s Smarty variables, add the following call:\n{debug} If you need to display a variable, add the following call:\n{dump($variableName)} Comments are based on asterisk:\n{* This string is commented out *} {* This string is too! *} Unlike with HTML comments, commented-out Smarty code is not present in the final output file.\n"

	"content": "Doctrine  From the 1.7.6 version of PrestaShop we integrate support of Doctrine services and entities for modules. Doctrine is a powerful ORM allowing you to manage your database data via objects. It offers an abstract layer allowing you to perform insert/update actions via a simple $entity-\u0026gt;setData('update') call. But you can also create your own repositories to fetch specific data via left join, add conditions and so on\u0026hellip;\nDoctrine is the default ORM integrated with Symfony which is why we added it for modules in legacy context. If you want more details about Doctrine and its features you can check their documentation or the Symfony documentation. PrestaShop is currently using Doctrine version 2.5.\nModule integration We meant to make the Doctrine integration the simplest possible, which is why we favored the annotation mapping which allows you to specify your database structure directly in your entity classes. We also used a simple convention, you simply need to put your entities in the src/Entity folder of your module and PrestaShop will automatically scan them for all installed modules.\nTo work correctly you will need to define a namespace for your entity classes using Composer, you can find more details about namespace setup in Setup composer page.\nDefine an Entity Here is a simple example of a ProductComment entity:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/src/Entity/ProductComment.php namespace YourCompany\\YourModule\\Entity; use Doctrine\\Common\\Collections\\ArrayCollection; use Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM; /** * @ORM\\Table() * @ORM\\Entity() */ class ProductComment { /** * @var int * * @ORM\\Id * @ORM\\Column(name=\u0026#34;id_product_comment\u0026#34;, type=\u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;) * @ORM\\GeneratedValue(strategy=\u0026#34;AUTO\u0026#34;) */ private $id; /** * @var int * * @ORM\\Column(name=\u0026#34;id_product\u0026#34;, type=\u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;) */ private $productId; /** * @var string * * @ORM\\Column(name=\u0026#34;customer_name\u0026#34;, type=\u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, length=64) */ private $customerName; /** * @var string * * @ORM\\Column(name=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;, type=\u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, length=64) */ private $title; /** * @var string * * @ORM\\Column(name=\u0026#34;content\u0026#34;, type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;) */ private $content; /** * @var int * * @ORM\\Column(name=\u0026#34;grade\u0026#34;, type=\u0026#34;integer\u0026#34;) */ private $grade; /** * @return int */ public function getId() { return $this-\u0026gt;id; } /** * @return int */ public function getProductId() { return $this-\u0026gt;productId; } /** * @param int $productId * * @return ProductComment */ public function setProductId($productId) { $this-\u0026gt;productId = $productId; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getCustomerName() { return $this-\u0026gt;customerName; } /** * @param string $customerName * * @return ProductComment */ public function setCustomerName($customerName) { $this-\u0026gt;customerName = $customerName; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getTitle() { return $this-\u0026gt;title; } /** * @param string $title * * @return ProductComment */ public function setTitle($title) { $this-\u0026gt;title = $title; return $this; } /** * @return string */ public function getContent() { return $this-\u0026gt;content; } /** * @param string $content * * @return ProductComment */ public function setContent($content) { $this-\u0026gt;content = $content; return $this; } /** * @return int */ public function getGrade() { return $this-\u0026gt;grade; } /** * @param int $grade * * @return ProductComment */ public function setGrade($grade) { $this-\u0026gt;grade = $grade; return $this; } /** * @return array */ public function toArray() { return [ \u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;getProductId(), \u0026#39;id_product_comment\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;getId(), \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;getTitle(), \u0026#39;content\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;getContent(), \u0026#39;customer_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;getCustomerName(), \u0026#39;grade\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;getGrade(), ]; } } Creating the database Although Doctrine includes a few tools including a command to help you build your database we strongly warn about NOT using them, they automatically include lots of foreign keys which are not compatible with the PrestaShop database structure.\nSo you will need to create your database tables on your module installation the way you used to, with SQL script for example. Doctrine uses a convention to match the database tables and your entities, it converts your camel case class name into a snake case table name. And on top of that PrestaShop automatically adds the database prefix you defined. So assuming you used ps_ as a prefix the matching will be:\n   Class name Table name     ProductComment ps_product_comment   ProductCommentList ps_product_comment_list    Although you must not use doctrine tools to affect your database directly, they can be handful to help you generate you SQL files. You can use this command ./bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql which will output (but not execute) the SQL queries required to update your database.\nYou can use this as a base to create your own SQL scripts, but remember not to modify PrestaShop core database structure and to clean the foreign key statements (unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure of what you are doing).\n Using Doctrine Saving an Entity Now that your Entity is managed and your database structure is up to date you can start creating/updating data in your database. Here is an example in a legacy controller:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/controllers/front/PostComment.php use YourCompany\\YourModule\\Entity\\ProductComment; use Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityManagerInterface; class YourModulePostCommentModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function display() { $id_product = (int) Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39;); $comment_title = Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;comment_title\u0026#39;); $comment_content = Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;comment_content\u0026#39;); $customer_name = Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;customer_name\u0026#39;); $grade = Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;grade\u0026#39;); /** @var EntityManagerInterface $entityManager */ $entityManager = $this-\u0026gt;container-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;doctrine.orm.entity_manager\u0026#39;); //Create product comment  $productComment = new ProductComment(); $productComment -\u0026gt;setProductId($id_product) -\u0026gt;setTitle($comment_title) -\u0026gt;setContent($comment_content) -\u0026gt;setCustomerName($customer_name) -\u0026gt;setGrade($grade) ; //This call adds the entity to the EntityManager scope (now it knows the entity exists)  $entityManager-\u0026gt;persist($productComment); //This call validates all previous modification (modified/persisted entities)  //This is when the database queries are performed  $entityManager-\u0026gt;flush(); $this-\u0026gt;ajaxRender(json_encode([ \u0026#39;success\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;product_comment\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $productComment-\u0026gt;toArray(), ])); } } Fetching your Entities An Entity repository is the service that will allow you to fetch your entities from the database. Doctrine already offers some generic repository, and what\u0026rsquo;s more? You don\u0026rsquo;t even need to create it yourself you simply get it via the entity manager.\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/controllers/front/ListComments.php use YourCompany\\YourModule\\Entity\\ProductComment; use Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityManagerInterface; class YourModuleListCommentsModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function display() { $id_product = (int) Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39;); /** @var EntityManagerInterface $entityManager */ $entityManager = $this-\u0026gt;container-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;doctrine.orm.entity_manager\u0026#39;); $productCommentRepository = $entityManager-\u0026gt;getRepository(ProductComment::class); //The repository has automatic methods available, it is able to creating query conditions  //based on the name of the function you used  /* ** The repository has automatic methods available, it is able to creating query conditions ** based on the name of the function you used.

Database access is controlled through files in the “classes” folder. Data control. User-provided content is controlled by files in the root folder. Design. All of the theme’s files are in the “themes” folder.  This is the same principle as the Model\u0026gt;View\u0026gt;Controller (MVC) architecture, only in a simpler and more accessible way.\nA 3-tier architecture has many advantages:\n It’s easier to read the software’s code. Developers can add and edit code faster. Graphic designer and HTML integrators can work with the confines of the /themes folder without having to understand or even read a single line of PHP code. Developers can work on additional data and modules that the HTML integrators can make use of.  Model A model represents the application’s behavior: data processing, database interaction, etc.\nIt describes or contains the data that have been processed by the application. It manages this data and guarantees its integrity.\nView A view is the interface with which the user interacts.\nIts first role is to display the data that has been provided by the model. Its second role is to handle all the actions from the user (mouse click, element selection, buttons, etc.), and send these events to the controller.\nThe view does not do any processing; it only displays the result of the processing performed by the model, and interacts with the user.\nController The Controller manages synchronization events between the Model and the View, and updates both as needed. It receives all the user events and triggers the actions to perform.\nIf an action needs data to be changed, the Controller will “ask” the Model to change the data, and in turn the Model will notify the View that the data has been changed, so that the View can update itself.\nMoving forward with Symfony While all versions of PrestaShop up to 1.6 took pride in only using a custom architecture, it was decided to incorporate the Symfony PHP framework starting with PrestaShop 1.7.\nThe driving idea is that we want our code to be more robust, more modular, and fully testable.

Clicking this button will trigger a series of methods, each leading closer to the latest version of your module.\nIn order to bring auto-update support to your module, you need three main things:\n Clearly indicate the module\u0026rsquo;s version number in its constructor method: $this-\u0026gt;version = '1.1'; Create an /upgrade sub-folder in the module\u0026rsquo;s folder. Add an auto-update PHP script for each new version.  Each script should contain a main method named upgrade_module_x_y_z, where x_y_z corresponds to the version the module is being upgraded to. It receives a single parameter, an instance of your Module.\nScript name Your script must be named upgrade, followed by a dash (-) and the version number, like upgrade-x.y.z.php.\nFor example:\n upgrade-1.2.3.php   For example:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * File: /upgrade/upgrade-1.1.php */ function upgrade_module_1_1($module) { // Process Module upgrade to 1.1  // ....  return true; // Return true if success. } \u0026hellip;and then:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * File: /upgrade/upgrade-1.2.php */ function upgrade_module_1_2($module) { // Process Module upgrade to 1.2  // ....  return true; // Return true if succes.  } Each method should bring the necessary changes to the module\u0026rsquo;s files and database data in order to reach the latest version.\nWhen upgrading a module, PrestaShop will crawl the module\u0026rsquo;s upgrade folder, and execute each upgrade script sequentially, starting from the first one whose version number is greater than the currently installed one. It is therefore highly advised to number your module\u0026rsquo;s versions sequentially, following the Semantic Versioning Specification.\nExample using the scripts above:\n   When upgrading from\u0026hellip; Target version Executed scripts     1.0.0 1.1.0 - upgrade-1.1.php   1.0.0 1.2.0 - upgrade-1.1.php\n- upgrade-1.2.php   1.1.0 1.2.0 - upgrade-1.2.php    Script examples Here is the /upgrade/upgrade-1.4.9.php file from the gamification module:\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } function upgrade_module_1_4_9($object) { return Db::getInstance()-\u0026gt;execute( \u0026#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `\u0026#39;._DB_PREFIX_.\u0026#39;tab_advice` ( `id_tab` int(11) NOT NULL, `id_advice` int(11) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id_tab`, `id_advice`) ) ENGINE=\u0026#39;._MYSQL_ENGINE_.\u0026#39; DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\u0026#39; ); } The homeslider module\u0026rsquo;s install-1.2.1.php file does even more:\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } function upgrade_module_1_2_1($object) { return Db::getInstance()-\u0026gt;execute( \u0026#39;UPDATE \u0026#39;._DB_PREFIX_.\u0026#39;homeslider_slides_lang SET \u0026#39;.homeslider_stripslashes_field(\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;).\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.homeslider_stripslashes_field(\u0026#39;description\u0026#39;).\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.homeslider_stripslashes_field(\u0026#39;legend\u0026#39;).\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.homeslider_stripslashes_field(\u0026#39;url\u0026#39;) ); } function homeslider_stripslashes_field($field) { $quotes = array(\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\\\\\\\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;); $dquotes = array(\u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\\\\\\\\\u0026#34;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); $backslashes = array(\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\\\\\\\\\u0026#34;\u0026#39;); return \u0026#39;`\u0026#39;.bqSQL($field).\u0026#39;` = replace(replace(replace(`\u0026#39;.bqSQL($field).\u0026#39;`, \u0026#39;.$quotes[0].\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.$quotes[1].\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;.$dquotes[0].\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.$dquotes[1].\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;.$backslashes[0].\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.$backslashes[1].\u0026#39;)\u0026#39;; } Adding/updating modules or hooks between versions If the new version of your module adds or update its hooks, you should make sure to update them too.\nIndeed, since the hooks are (usually) defined when the module is installed, PrestaShop will not install the module again in order to include the new hooks' code, so you have to use the upgrade methods:\nFor instance, here\u0026rsquo;s the install-1.2.php file from the blockbestseller module:\n\u0026lt;?php if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } function upgrade_module_1_2($object) { return ($object-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;addproduct\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $object-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;updateproduct\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $object-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;deleteproduct\u0026#39;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $object-\u0026gt;registerHook(\u0026#39;actionOrderStatusPostUpdate\u0026#39;)); } How to test-run an upgrade Here\u0026rsquo;s how to test that your upgrade scripts work correctly.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume that you are working on a module that you already have it installed in your development shop, and you\u0026rsquo;re on version 1.0.0. On the upcoming version 1.1.0 that you are currently developing, you need to update your database schema.\nSince the version that you are planning to update to is 1.1.0, the first thing would be to create an upgrade script for that version:\n\u0026lt;?php // File: /upgrade/upgrade-1.1.0.php  if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_VERSION_\u0026#39;)) { exit; } function upgrade_module_1_1_0($module) { // do your thing here  return true; } Now, update your module version to 1.1.0:\n\u0026lt;?php class my_module extends Module { public function __construct() { $this-\u0026gt;name = \u0026#39;my_module\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;version = \u0026#39;1.1.0\u0026#39;; // \u0026lt;--- previously 1.0.0  } } Then, in your PrestaShop backoffice, go to Modules \u0026gt; Module Manager and find your module. Since you have updated its version, PrestaShop will notice that there\u0026rsquo;s an update available for it and prompt you to upgrade it. Press the \u0026ldquo;Upgrade\u0026rdquo; button, and PrestaShop will invoke your upgrade script.\n"

There is a simple rule to guess which template will be rendered: {grid_id}_{column_id}_type_id where grid_id and column_id are not required.\n If you define the template {...}/Columns/Content/data.html.twig in your module, this template will be overriden for the Back Office; If you define the template {...}/Columns/Content/my_grid_data.html.twig in your module, this template will be overriden for the Grid defined with the id my_grid;  And what will happens if you define the following template? my-module/views/PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/Columns/Content/my_grid_name_action.html.twig\nYou\u0026rsquo;re right, the template will be overriden only for the column type \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; with the id \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo;. So extensible and powerful!\n"

	"content": "Overrides Overriding is a way to \u0026ldquo;override\u0026rdquo; class files and controller files. PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s ingenious class auto-loading function makes the \u0026ldquo;switch\u0026rdquo; to other files fairly simple. Thanks to PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s fully object-oriented code, you can rely on object inheritance to modify and add new behaviors, using the properties and methods of the various existing classes.\nImportant note There are limitations and risks of using overrides. Keep them for your own shop. Overrides in PrestaShop are exclusive. This means that if your module overrides one of PrestaShop’s behaviors, another module will not be able to use that behavior properly, or override it in an predictable way.\nTherefore, overrides should only be used for your own local modules, when you have a specific need that cannot be applied with it.\nIt is not recommended to use an override in a module that you intend to distribute (for instance through the PrestaShop Addons marketplace), and they are forbidden in partner modules.\nAlternatives to overrides Before creating an override, check the existing features can help you:\nHooks There are many events triggered on each controller of PrestaShop. They can be used for displaying additional content or executing module actions.\nSee the hooks chapter for more details.\nClasses If a class does not make what a module expects, you can extend it in a module for improvement.\nFor instance you could have a single Tools class for core and module helper methods:\n\u0026lt;?php class MyCustomTools extends Tools { /** * Adding a new method for the example */ public static function array_pluck(array $data, \u0026#39;property\u0026#39;) { // [...]  } } Once included in another file, all these following method would be callable:\n\u0026lt;?php MyCustomTools::array_pluck($data, \u0026#39;id\u0026#39;); MyCustomTools::getValue(\u0026#39;userId\u0026#39;); // Defined in Tools MyCustomTools::getShopDomain(); // Defined in Tools Controllers Core controllers can be reused in a module as well, without being erased, thanks to inheritance.\nThis allows a controller to be maintained easily, with its own identity but with the parent features.\nSee the controllers chapter for more details.\nService overrides PrestaShop is migrating to Symfony, and the parts migrated rely on Symfony container which enables service overrides and decorations. This is similar to overrides but avoids class erasing.\nSee the Symfony services chapter for more details.\nContributing Sometimes, the existing features may not be enough for your needs. An event can be missing, or a controller method should be probably better in a dedicated class to be accessible.\nIf you think some changes in the core would be useful for the community, we encourage you to suggest them on the PrestaShop source code with a pull request.\nBy doing so, you may cover long-term needs the core developers probably don\u0026rsquo;t know about.\nClass \u0026amp; controller override If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any other choice, classes and controllers are usually built following a certain norm.\nHere is the core Product class and controller:\n /classes/Product.php. The class is called ProductCore. /controllers/front/ProductController.php. The controller class is called ProductControllerCore.  You will need to create a PHP file and place it either of the override folders of a module. Indeed, since PrestaShop 1.5, these files can be stored within a module and their management will follow it.\nOverriding a class does not mean to copy paste the whole file content.

	"content": "Overrides Overriding is a way to \u0026ldquo;override\u0026rdquo; class files and controller files. PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s ingenious class auto-loading function makes the \u0026ldquo;switch\u0026rdquo; to other files fairly simple. Thanks to PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s fully object-oriented code, you can rely on object inheritance to modify and add new behaviors, using the properties and methods of the various existing classes.\nImportant note There are limitations and risks of using overrides. Keep them for your own shop. Overrides in PrestaShop are exclusive. This means that if your module overrides one of PrestaShop’s behaviors, another module will not be able to use that behavior properly, or override it in an predictable way.\nTherefore, overrides should only be used for your own local modules, when you have a specific need that cannot be applied with it.\nIt is not recommended to use an override in a module that you intend to distribute (for instance through the PrestaShop Addons marketplace), and they are forbidden in partner modules.\nAlternatives to overrides Before creating an override, check the existing features can help you:\nHooks There are many events triggered on each controller of PrestaShop. They can be used for displaying additional content or executing module actions.\nSee the hooks chapter for more details.\nClasses If a class does not make what a module expects, you can extend it in a module for improvement.\nFor instance you could have a single Tools class for core and module helper methods:\n\u0026lt;?php class MyCustomTools extends Tools { /** * Adding a new method for the example */ public static function array_pluck(array $data, \u0026#39;property\u0026#39;) { // [...]  } } Once included in another file, all these following method would be callable:\n\u0026lt;?php MyCustomTools::array_pluck($data, \u0026#39;id\u0026#39;); MyCustomTools::getValue(\u0026#39;userId\u0026#39;); // Defined in Tools MyCustomTools::getShopDomain(); // Defined in Tools Controllers Core controllers can be reused in a module as well, without being erased, thanks to inheritance.\nThis allows a controller to be maintained easily, with its own identity but with the parent features.\nSee the controllers chapter for more details.\nService overrides PrestaShop is migrating to Symfony, and the parts migrated rely on Symfony container which enables service overrides and decorations. This is similar to overrides but avoids class erasing.\nSee the Symfony services chapter for more details.\nContributing Sometimes, the existing features may not be enough for your needs. An event can be missing, or a controller method should be probably better in a dedicated class to be accessible.\nIf you think some changes in the core would be useful for the community, we encourage you to suggest them on the PrestaShop source code with a pull request.\nBy doing so, you may cover long-term needs the core developers probably don\u0026rsquo;t know about.\nClass \u0026amp; controller override If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any other choice, classes and controllers are usually built following a certain norm.\nHere is the core Product class and controller:\n /classes/Product.php. The class is called ProductCore. /controllers/front/ProductController.php. The controller class is called ProductControllerCore.  You will need to create a PHP file and place it either of the override folders of a module. Indeed, since PrestaShop 1.5, these files can be stored within a module and their management will follow it.\nOverriding a class does not mean to copy paste the whole file content. As long as you extend the core equivalent class, you are free to override only one method or as many as you need.\nOverriding a class In order to override the Product class, your file needs to be called Product.php and must feature a Product class that then extends ProductCore class.\nThe file should be placed in this module location:\n/modules/\u0026lt;module_name\u0026gt;/override/classes/Product.php.\nIt will be copied in /override/classes/Product.php during the module installation, and removed automatically on uninstall.\nThere is an example module that overrides Manufacturer and adds a field to database. See DemoOverrideObjectModel. Note that it is always recommended creating custom table and use custom ObjectModel instead of override. Overriding a controller In order to override the ProductController class, your file needs to be called ProductController.php and must feature a ProductController class that then extends ProductControllerCore class.\nThe file should be placed in this module location:\n/modules/\u0026lt;module_name\u0026gt;/override/controllers/front/ProductController.php.\nIt will be copied in /override/controllers/front/ProductController.php during the module installation, and removed automatically on uninstall.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s consider the file /modules/\u0026lt;module_name\u0026gt;/override/classes/controllers/FrontController.php, overriding only one method of the core file.\n\u0026lt;?php /* * With this override, you have a new Smarty variable called \u0026#34;currentController\u0026#34; available in header.tpl * This allows you to use a different header if you are on a product page, category page or home. */ class FrontController extends FrontControllerCore { public function initHeader() { self::$smarty-\u0026gt;assign(\u0026#39;currentController\u0026#39;, get_class($this)); return parent::initHeader(); } } Theme template override Overriding a theme from a module is NOT possible, and never will.

	"content": "Chapter 8 How to make PrestaShop scale Scaling your PrestaShop installation is something we hope every merchant will need, because it means their business is growing.\nHopefully, there are plenty of advices in these pages that will help.\nScalings Before doing anything to your PrestaShop setup, there are several things you need to know.\nFirst, be aware that there are several ways to scale any application, PrestaShop incuded.\nVertical scaling The most used one is called vertical scaling, where you boost your server\u0026rsquo;s performance : you add some RAM, some CPU, increase the disks IOs performances, and so on. It can be quick and easy if your hoster allows it and does not require any change in your application setup and configuration.\nHowever, this method is not the most efficient one, as doubling the server\u0026rsquo;s resources will not necessarily double its oberved performances.\nIn addition, the monetary cost of vertical scaling may not be linear. Depending on your hosting company, your mileage may vary.\nIn some cases, doubling your server capacity may cost you more than twice its original price.\nHorizontal scaling Generally, the most efficient way to scale an application\u0026rsquo;s performance remains adding more servers.\nIt may not be as simple as it sounds, as PrestaShop requires many files being shared (or at least synchronized) across the instances, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that hard when you have figured it out.\nAlso, once you have set up your first server, setting additional ones should be far easier.\nThe good thing is that, though requiring more sweat at first, horizontal scaling is better in terms of performances. Done well, adding a second server may easily double your application performance, if not more.\nFurther than LAMP Another way to scale your shop is to introduce other systems to improve your performances. Here is a quicklist of what can be used:\n Using a HTTP accelerator such as Varnish for Front Office Using an in-memory data structure store such as Redis to store sessions Use Elasticsearch or a solution built on it for processing customer searches Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static files  Note: services like a CDN or HTTP accelerator are useful in a production environment, not in a development environment.\n"

	"content": "Chapter 8 How to make PrestaShop scale Scaling your PrestaShop installation is something we hope every merchant will need, because it means their business is growing.\nHopefully, there are plenty of advices in these pages that will help.\nScalings Before doing anything to your PrestaShop setup, there are several things you need to know.\nFirst, be aware that there are several ways to scale any application, PrestaShop incuded.\nVertical scaling The most used one is called vertical scaling, where you boost your server\u0026rsquo;s performance : you add some RAM, some CPU, increase the disks IOs performances, and so on. It can be quick and easy if your hoster allows it and does not require any change in your application setup and configuration.\nHowever, this method is not the most efficient one, as doubling the server\u0026rsquo;s resources will not necessarily double its oberved performances.\nIn addition, the monetary cost of vertical scaling may not be linear. Depending on your hosting company, your mileage may vary.\nIn some cases, doubling your server capacity may cost you more than twice its original price.\nHorizontal scaling Generally, the most efficient way to scale an application\u0026rsquo;s performance remains adding more servers.\nIt may not be as simple as it sounds, as PrestaShop requires many files being shared (or at least synchronized) across the instances, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that hard when you have figured it out.\nAlso, once you have set up your first server, setting additional ones should be far easier.\nThe good thing is that, though requiring more sweat at first, horizontal scaling is better in terms of performances. Done well, adding a second server may easily double your application performance, if not more.\nFurther than LAMP Another way to scale your shop is to introduce other systems to improve your performances. Here is a quicklist of what can be used:\n Using a HTTP accelerator such as Varnish for Front Office Using an in-memory data structure store such as Redis to store sessions Use Elasticsearch or a solution built on it for processing customer searches Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static files  Note: services like a CDN or HTTP accelerator are useful in a production environment, not in a development environment.\n"

	"content": "Services  Symfony Services You have the ability to modify the Symfony container configuration from a module. This means that\n You have the possibility to define your own Symfony services from your modules. You have the possibility to modify existing Symfony services declaration from your modules, which is somehow an Override mechanism  Create and declare a new Symfony service First we strongly advise you to use namespaces \u0026amp; autoloading in your module, which can be done thanks to composer. A dedicated chapter is available to learn more about Composer and to set it up.\nDefine your service At first you will need to create a class for your service of course:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/src/YourService.php namespace YourCompany\\YourModule; use Symfony\\Component\\Translation\\TranslatorInterface; class YourService { /** @var TranslatorInterface */ private $translator; /** @var string */ private $customMessage; /** * @param string $customMessage */ public function __construct( TranslatorInterface $translator, $customMessage ) { $this-\u0026gt;translator = $translator; $this-\u0026gt;customMessage = $customMessage; } /** * @return string */ public function getTranslatedCustomMessage() { return $this-\u0026gt;translator-\u0026gt;trans($this-\u0026gt;customMessage, [], \u0026#39;Modules.YourModule\u0026#39;); } } Now that your namespace is setup, you can define your services in the config/services.yml file of your module.\n# yourmodule/config/services.ymlservices:_defaults:public:trueyour_company.your_module.your_service:class:YourCompany\\YourModule\\YourServicearguments:- \u0026#34;@translator\u0026#34;- \u0026#34;My custom message\u0026#34;This will then allow you to get your service from the Symfony container, like in your modern controllers:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/src/Controller/DemoController.php namespace YourCompany\\YourModule\\Controller; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; class DemoController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { public function demoAction() { $yourService = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;your_company.your_module.your_service\u0026#39;); return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@Modules/yourmodule/templates/admin/demo.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;customMessage\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $yourService-\u0026gt;getTranslatedCustomMessage(), ]); } }  If you need more details about dependency injection and how services work in the Symfony environment we recommend you to read their documentation about the Service Container. Override an existing Symfony service The container definition can be modified by a module, which enables you to override an existing Symfony service being used in PrestaShop.\nThis is a mechanism similar to PrestaShop standard overrides, but the main benefit is that the php code stays unmodified. This prevents issues linked to code definition or autoloading failures.\nAs you can read it from the Symfony documentation, there are 2 ways to modify an existing service:\nOverride the service When you choose to override a service, this means that you replace the service by another one. The previous service is not usable anymore. Every other part of the code where this service is used will use the new version.\nTo do it: you declare your new service using the old service name. So if you want to override the service prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature with your own implementation, you write in config/services.yml :\nprestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature:class:\u0026#39;YourCompany\\YourModule\\YourService\u0026#39;That\u0026rsquo;s done. The service registered under the name prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature is now your service. The previous prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature is gone.\nDecorate the service When you choose to decorate a service, this means that you make everybody use your service but you keep the old service available. The previous service has been given a new name and can still be used. Every other part of the code where this service was used will use the new version.\nTo do it: you declare your new service using the \u0026lsquo;decorates\u0026rsquo; keyword. So if you want to decorates the service prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature with my own implementation, you write in config/services.yml :\nmymodule.my_own_b2b_feature_service:class:\u0026#39;YourCompany\\YourModule\\YourService\u0026#39;decorates:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature\u0026#39;That\u0026rsquo;s done. The service registered under the name mymodule.my_own_b2b_feature_service is now your service. The previous prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature implementation is still available under the name mymodule.my_own_b2b_feature_service.inner.\nThis means that in your container you can access 3 services now:\n mymodule.my_own_b2b_feature_service your service prestashop.core.b2b.b2b_feature is now an alias for mymodule.my_own_b2b_feature_service (see service aliases) so the other services which rely on it now use your implementation mymodule.my_own_b2b_feature_service.inner is the previous implementation, still available  The decoration strategy can be very useful if:\n you want some areas of your code to use the new service, some others to use the old service you want to use the old service in the implementation of the new service  Indeed sometimes what you want is to modify a small part of the behavior of a class. So why replace it entirely ? You can reuse the existing behavior and modify only the needed part:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/src/YourService.php namespace YourCompany\\YourModule; class YourService { private $decoratedService; /** * @param DecoratedService $decoratedService */ public function __construct($decoratedService) { $this-\u0026gt;decoratedService = $decoratedService; } /** * We want to modify the behavior of the function getTranslatedCustomMessage * without replacing the whole DecoratedService implementation * * @return string */ public function getTranslatedCustomMessage() { $unmodifiedOutput = $this-\u0026gt;decoratedService-\u0026gt;getTranslatedCustomMessage(); $modifiedOutput = $this-\u0026gt;modifyTheOutput($unmodifiedOutput); return $modifiedOutput; } } This is only possible with service decoration, not service override, because the previous service is still available.\nFinding the right service The Symfony command php ./bin/console debug:container will provide you with a list of all the registered services.\nMaintaining compatibility What happens, however, if the service you have overriden or decorated is used somewhere else ? You have to make sure your modifications are still compatible with this place in order not to break any existing behavior.\nEven worse: what if another part of the code especially requires this class, like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * @param ASpecificClass $service */ public function __construct(ASpecificClass $service) { // ...  } Here, this constructor will crash if you provide something else than an instance of ASpecificClass to it.\nIn order to avoid this crash, 2 options are available:\nPrestaShop classes rely more and more on interfaces. So if this code has been built with the idea of customization/extension in mind, instead of public function __construct(ASpecificClass $service) you should have:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * @param MyInterface $service */ public function __construct(MyInterface $service) { // ...  } Your new service, which overrides or decorates the previous service, only needs to implement the interface to be compatible with it.\nIf however no interface was used here, you probably need to extend the previous class, ASpecificClass, instead.\nAs you can see, interfaces lay the ground for easy extension and customization, that is why we use them more and more in the Core codebase and we recommend you use them as well !\nServices in Legacy environment  Being able to declare services for Symfony environment is a nice feature when you use modern controllers, however when you are on front office or in a legacy page in the back office (meaning a page that has not been migrated yet with Symfony) you can\u0026rsquo;t access the Symfony container or your services.\nSince the version 1.7.6 you can now define your services and access them in the legacy environment. We manage a light container for this environment (PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Adapter\\ContainerBuilder) which is accessible from legacy containers.\nTo define your services you need to follow the same principle as Symfony services, but this time you need to place your definition files in sub folders:\n config/admin/services.yml will define the services accessible in the back office (in legacy environment AND Symfony environment) config/front/services.yml will define the services accessible in the front office  Accessing your services You can then access your services from any legacy controllers (in which the container is automatically injected):\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/controllers/front/Demo.php class YourModuleDemoModuleFrontController extends ModuleFrontController { public function display() { ... $yourService = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;your_company.your_module.front.your_service\u0026#39;); ... } } \u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/controllers/admin/demo.php // Legacy controllers have no namespace class YourModuleDemoModuleAdminController extends ModuleAdminController { public function display() { ... $yourService = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;your_company.your_module.admin.your_service\u0026#39;); ... } } But you can also access them from your module, to display its content or in hooks:\n\u0026lt;?php // modules/yourmodule/yourmodule.php class yourmodule { public function getContent() { ... // The controller here is the ADMIN one so only admin services are accessible  $yourService = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;your_company.your_module.admin.your_service\u0026#39;); ... } public function hookDisplayFooterProduct($params) { ... // The controller here is the FRONT one so only front services are accessible  $yourService = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;your_company.your_module.front.your_service\u0026#39;); ... } } Environments Keep in mind that the legacy container is a light version of the full Symfony container so you won\u0026rsquo;t have access to all the Symfony components. But you will be able to use the Doctrine service as well as a few few core services from PrestaShop.\nFor more details about available services you can check in \u0026lt;PS_ROOT_DIR\u0026gt;/config/services/ folder which services are available in admin or front. Be careful and always keep in mind in which context/environment you are calling your service.\nHere is a quick summary so that you know where you should define your services:\n   Definition file Symfony Container Front Legacy Container Admin Legacy Container Available services     config/services.yml Yes No No All symfony components and PrestaShopBundle services   config/admin/services.yml Yes No Yes Doctrine, services defined in \u0026lt;PS_ROOT_DIR\u0026gt;/config/services/admin folder   config/front/services.yml Yes Yes No Doctrine, services defined in \u0026lt;PS_ROOT_DIR\u0026gt;/config/services/front folder    Define a service on both front and admin Sometimes services are only useful in a particular context (back-office or front-office), but sometime you also need them on both (a Doctrine repository is a good example). You could easily define the same services in both environment but it\u0026rsquo;s very modular and can create errors in case of modifications.\nAn easy trick is to create a common definition file which will then be included by each environment:\n# yourmodule/config/common.ymlservices:_defaults:public:trueyour_company.your_module.common.open_service:class:YourCompany\\YourModule\\YourServicearguments:- \u0026#39;@your_company.your_module.common.open_dependency\u0026#39;your_company.your_module.common.open_dependency:class:YourCompany\\YourModule\\YourServiceDependencyThen you can include this file in the environment you wish (front, admin, Symfony);\n# yourmodule/config/services.ymlimports:- {resource:./common.yml }# yourmodule/config/admin/services.ymlimports:- {resource:../common.yml }# yourmodule/config/front/services.ymlimports:- {resource:../common.yml }"

	"content": "Coding standards Consistency is important, even more so when writing open-source code, since the code belongs to millions of eyeballs, and bug-fixing relies on these teeming millions to actually locate bugs and understand how to solve them.\nThis is why, when writing anything for PrestaShop, be it a theme, a module or a core patch, you should strive to follow the following guidelines. They are the ones that PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s developers adhere to, and following them is the surest way to have your code be elegantly integrated in PrestaShop.\nIn short, code consistency helps keeping the code readable and maintainable.\nGeneral conventions All files containing code MUST:\n Use only UTF-8 without BOM. Use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending. End with a single blank line.  Code documentation Make sure that classes, attributes and methods are properly documented using doc blocks, regardless of visibility. As a rule of thumb, consider that a developer should be able to understand a component and use it without even having to read the source code – signatures and doc blocks should suffice for most cases.\nPay particular attention to the following:\n Describe the class\u0026rsquo;s purpose. If you have a hard time describing what the class is meant for, it may be a sign that it has too many responsibilites and needs to be decomposed. Describe intent, not implementation. Explain what the method/class is for, not how it performs it—unless that information is important for the developer using it. Document attributes, parameters and return values both in type and semantics. A variable named $content might be obviously a string, but we need more context to understand what its purpose is. It is preferable to waste time describing the obvious than to leave the ambiguous open to interpretation. This prevents more bugs than you can imagine.  PHP code conventions PHP files MUST follow the PSR-2 standard alongside Symfony standards.\nAlthough Yoda conditions are suggested, they are not enforced. Making your code follow our coding standards PHP CS Fixer has been configured for the PrestaShop project to help developers to comply with these conventions.\nYou can run it using the following command:\nphp ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix The prestashop specific configuration file can be found here. Also, you can also use the provided git pre-commit sample in order to make sure you never forget to make your code compliant!\nDocumenting types Parameters and return values SHOULD be described using Phpdoc as documented by Phpstan, especially when the type cannot be strictly defined using PHP types (e.g. collections, structs, mixed types).\nExample:\n/** * @var string[] Collection of IETF language tag (eg. \u0026#34;en-US\u0026#34;) */ public $locales; Particular attention should be paid to documenting arrays and array structures:\n Use the simplified syntax for collections, like string[] or SomeType[]. If the array\u0026rsquo;s index is relevant (e.g., non-sequential), use the generics-style annotation, like array\u0026lt;int, string\u0026gt;. If the array is actually a struct (i.e. an associative array whose schema is known), then it MUST be described it using the array shape annotation, like array{'foo': int, \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;: string}.  Strict typing  Starting on 1.7.7, all new PHP code should be strictly typed.\nThis means that all new methods must specify a type for all parameters as well as the return type. Similarly, all new classes except interfaces must enforce type strictness via declare:\n\u0026lt;?php /** 2007-2020 PrestaShop SA and Contributors... */ declare(strict_types=1); namespace Foo\\Bar; class MyClass { public function doStuff(string $foo, array $bar): void { } }  It\u0026rsquo;s important to have all classes declare type strictness. Since PHP 7 is still inherently weakly typed, it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to have your class declare type strictness to make it enforce type strictness. If the class consuming your code does not enforce type strictness as well, methods called by it will have their parameters silently coerced into the specified type instead of being type checked. Read this article for more details and examples. Deprecations Following Symfony conventions, method and class deprecations in PrestaShop must be noted by adding the appropriate Phpdoc as well as a deprecation error:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\Awesome\\Path; @trigger_error( sprintf( \u0026#39;%s is deprecated since version 1.7.8.0 and will be removed in the next major version.\u0026#39;, MyClass::class ), E_USER_DEPRECATED ); /** * @deprecated Since 1.7.8.0 and will be removed in the next major. */ class MyClass { /** * @deprecated Since 1.7.6.0, use AnotherClass::someNewMethod() instead. */ public function someOldMethod() { @trigger_error( sprintf( \u0026#39;%s is deprecated since version 1.7.6.0. Use %s instead.\u0026#39;, __METHOD__, AnotherClass::class . \u0026#39;::someNewMethod()\u0026#39; ), E_USER_DEPRECATED ); } } If you need to deprecate services, you can use the deprecated key for the service:\nawesome.path.myclass:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\Awesome\\Path\\MyClass\u0026#39;deprecated:\u0026#39;The \u0026#34;%service_id%\u0026#34; service is deprecated since 1.7.8.0 and will be removed in next major.\u0026#39;public:trueJavascript code conventions Javascript files MUST follow the Airbnb Javascript style guide.\nStarting on 1.7.8  , you can run the linter to help you comply with these coding standards:\nnpm run lint-fix HTML, CSS (Sass), Twig \u0026amp; Smarty code conventions HTML, CSS (Sass), Twig and Smarty files MUST follow the Mark Otto\u0026rsquo;s coding standards.

In brief, the CQRS pattern suggests to separate \u0026ldquo;write\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; models, which it refers to as Commands and Queries. In a web application like a CMS, we perform either \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; operations which return information to the user or \u0026ldquo;write\u0026rdquo; operations which modify the data managed by the application.\nWhy using CQRS in PrestaShop? During Back Office migration to Symfony, PrestaShop needs a way to access and alter data on the new Symfony pages without multiplying the sources of truth, and without accessing ObjectModel (e.g. Product, Category) directly.\nCommands and Queries allow us to isolate the controllers from the data source, which can be later replaced by something else while leaving behind a nice API.\nThis implementation proposes a \u0026ldquo;top-down\u0026rdquo; design, which inverses the classic data-driven design. It starts on a page and the actions performed in it, and then trickles down layer by layer, finishing on the data layer.\nDifference between legacy \u0026amp; new architectures In legacy architecture, controller is calling ObjectModel directly, without providing clear API or separation between read and write model, thus highly coupling data layer with controller.

It DOES NOT contain behavior (at least for now).  Command and CommandHandler principles  Any alteration on the state of the application MUST be performed through a Command. A Command describes a single action. It DOES NOT perform it. A Command receives only primitive types on input (int, float, string, bool and array).

A CommandHandler acts as a port to a Core, therefore it SHOULD NOT handle the domain logic itself, but orchestrate the necessary services instead. A CommandHandler MUST be placed in the Adapter namespace as long as it has legacy dependencies. A CommandHandler SHOULD NOT return anything on success, and SHOULD throw a typed Exception on failure. The \u0026ldquo;no return on success\u0026rdquo; rule can be broken only when creating entities. A CommandHandler MUST implement an interface containing a single public method like this:  \u0026lt;?php public function handle(NameOfTheCommand $command); Query and QueryHandler principles  Data retrieval SHOULD always go through a Query.

	"content": "Getting Started About CRUD \u0026amp; REST The PrestaShop web service uses the REST architecture in order to be available on as many platforms as possible, since the HTTP protocol and XML files are understood by most platforms, if not all.\nCRUD is an acronym that stands for \u0026ldquo;Create, Read, Update, and Delete\u0026rdquo;. These are the four basic operations for managing data in an application.\nREST defines roughly a style of software architecture, which promotes the use of HTTP methods when building web application, instead of custom methods or protocols such as SOAP or WSDL. It defines several rules, including one that is similar to CRUD, which is described below.\n HTTP has several methods that can perform processing on data as defined in the REST architecture, among which are 4 main methods:\n   HTTP/REST CRUD SQL     POST Create INSERT   GET Read SELECT   PUT Update UPDATE   DELETE Delete DELETE    Enabling \u0026amp; Creating an access to the webservice Reach the dedicated page.\nAccessing the webservice Now that your access key is generated you can test your store\u0026rsquo;s webservice, its endpoint is located in the /api/ folder at the root of your installation of Prestashop. The quickest way to test your API is to use your browser:\n If PrestaShop is installed at the root of your server, you can access the API here: http://example.com/api/ If PrestaShop is installed in a subfolder of your server, you can access the API here: http://example.com/prestashop/api/  The endpoint /api is reachable if URL is correctly rewritten to use it. For httpd, this is done by the .htaccess which means you need to make sure httpd is processing this file (it needs mod_rewrite enabled and VirtualHost must have AllowOverride All). The shop should prompt you for a username and a password to enter. The username is the authentication key you created and there is no password to enter.\nThe second and more appropriate way to access the API is to include your access key in the url, this will prevent you from entering any user name. This is also the recommended way to call the API from a javascript client, or any application. Here is an example, assuming your access API key is UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX:\n At the root of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/api/ In a subfolder of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/prestashop/api/  To test/call your APIs we recommend you use an API client such as Insomnia or Postman, it is easier to call the APIs than with a browser, especially for write actions. As you noticed no password nor authentication process is required to access the APIs which is why you need to be extra careful with you access key rights and how (and to whom) you disclose them. Using your webservice API Describe a resource When you call the root /api url you will get a summary of the available APIs you can call with your access token. In this example we see that we have all rights on the /api/addresses API:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prestashop xmlns:xlink=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;api shopName=\u0026#34;Prestashop\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;addresses xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses\u0026#34; get=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; put=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; post=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; delete=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; head=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses\u0026#34; get=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; put=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; post=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; delete=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; head=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt; The Customer, Brand and Customer addresses\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;schema xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses?schema=blank\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;blank\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;schema xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses?schema=synopsis\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;synopsis\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/addresses\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/api\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/prestashop\u0026gt; Each API comes with two schema APIs:\n /api/RESOURCE?schema=synopsis returns basic info on the API format, the name of fields and their type /api/RESOURCE?schema=blank will return a default blank data which you could use as a base for your write actions  Both calls are very much alike, only synopsis contains more information about the data format and types:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prestashop xmlns:xlink=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_customer format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_customer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_manufacturer format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_manufacturer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_supplier format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_supplier\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_warehouse format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_warehouse\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_country required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_country\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_state format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_state\u0026gt; \u0026lt;alias required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;32\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isGenericName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/alias\u0026gt; \u0026lt;company maxSize=\u0026#34;255\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isGenericName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/company\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lastname required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;255\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/lastname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;firstname required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;255\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/firstname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;vat_number format=\u0026#34;isGenericName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/vat_number\u0026gt; \u0026lt;address1 required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;128\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isAddress\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/address1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;address2 maxSize=\u0026#34;128\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isAddress\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/address2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;postcode maxSize=\u0026#34;12\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isPostCode\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/postcode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;city required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;64\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isCityName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/city\u0026gt; \u0026lt;other maxSize=\u0026#34;300\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isMessage\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/other\u0026gt; \u0026lt;phone maxSize=\u0026#34;32\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isPhoneNumber\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/phone\u0026gt; \u0026lt;phone_mobile maxSize=\u0026#34;32\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isPhoneNumber\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/phone_mobile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dni maxSize=\u0026#34;16\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isDniLite\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/dni\u0026gt; \u0026lt;deleted format=\u0026#34;isBool\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/deleted\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date_add format=\u0026#34;isDate\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/date_add\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date_upd format=\u0026#34;isDate\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/date_upd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/prestashop\u0026gt; Read a resource Each resource comes with an XLink argument.

If you want individual record with specific fields, you need to use both display and filter parameters. A response obtained with \u0026ldquo;display\u0026rdquo; other than \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; can\u0026rsquo;t be used in a PUT (update) request, because the WebserviceRequest class validation for fields is the same for POST (create) and PUT (update).\nThis should be fixed in a near future with a yet-to-come-pull-request introducing the PATCH method!\n Control returned items with \u0026ldquo;filter\u0026rdquo; The EQUAL operator is used when you need to get specific items. For exemple, if you want the addresses for customer #1, you can filter your GET request with the filter parameter: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[id_customer]=1\nThe LIKE operator is used when you need to search for items. For exemple, if you want the addresses with cities starting with \u0026ldquo;SAINT\u0026rdquo;: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[city]=[saint]%\nThe AND operator is used when you need to get items matching several criteria: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[city]=[paris|lyon]\nOther operators can be used, such as:\n NOT EQUAL (single value): http://example.com/api/customers?filter[firstname]=![hubert] (apologies to all Huberts) NOT EQUAL (multiple values): http://example.com/api/customers?filter[firstname]=![hubert|leon|gaspard] (apologies again\u0026hellip;) GREATER THAN: http://example.com/api/customers?filter[birthday]=\u0026gt;[2000-00-00%2000:00:00] (millenials only 🙂) LOWER THAN: http://example.com/api/customers?filter[birthday]=\u0026lt;[2000-00-00%2000:00:00] (previous century only 😄)  This can be used in combination with the display parameter! Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to get the mobile phone numbers of customers #1, #7 and #42: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[id_customer]=[1|7|42]\u0026amp;display=[phone_mobile]\nYou can also filter by dates! A typical example would be a routine in an ERP fetching the orders since the last call: http://example.com/api/orders?display=full\u0026amp;date=1\u0026amp;filter[date_add]=[2019-11-14%2013:00:00,2019-11-14%2014:00:00]. In this exemple, we request the orders created on 2019-11-14 between 1pm and 2pm.\nPay attention to:\n The url-encoded space (%20) in the datetime values The date=1 parameter used to allow date filtering The dates range, with an inclusive first member and an exclusive last member (from 13:00:00 to 13:59:59)   Special parameters The date=1 parameter must be used to allow date filtering (see exemple above).\nThe limit=0,100 parameter can be used to limit the number of returned items (similar to MySQL\u0026rsquo;s LIMIT clause).\nThe sort=[field1_ASC,field2_DESC] parameter can be used to sort the results (similar to MySQL\u0026rsquo;s ORDER BY clause, with underscore to separate the field name and the order way).\nThe language=1 or language=[1|2] parameter can be used to return only these languages for translatable fields (eg: product description, category name, etc.).\nThe sendemail=1 parameter can be used if you need to change the state of an order AND you want the emails to be sent to the customer: you will have to do a POST on http://example.com/api/order_histories?sendemail=1\nCreate a resource To create a resource, you simply need to GET the XML blank data for the resource (example /api/addresses?schema=blank), fill it with your changes, and send POST HTTP request with the whole XML as body content to the /api/addresses/ URL.\nPrestaShop will take care of adding everything in the database, and will return an XML file indicating that the operation has been successful, along with the ID of the newly created customer.\nUpdate a resource To edit an existing resource: GET the full XML file for the resource you want to change (example /api/addresses/1), edit its content as needed, then send a PUT HTTP request with the whole XML file as a body content to the same URL again.\nUsing JSON instead of XML The Web services can also output JSON instead of XML. To enable JSON output you have two choices:\nQuery parameter Add one of the following parameters to your query string:\n output_format=JSON io_format=JSON  Example:\nhttps://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/api/?output_format=JSON HTTP header Add the one of the following headers to your HTTP request:\n Io-Format: JSON Output-Format: JSON  Example:\nGET /api/ HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Output-Format: JSON Authorization: Basic VUNDTExROU4yQVJTSFdDWExUNzRLVUtTU0szNEJGS1g6  Note that the API key has been encoded in Base64 for use in headers, as explained in Using an authorization header.

Here is an example, assuming your access API key is UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX:\n At the root of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/api/ In a subfolder of the server: https://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/prestashop/api/  To test/call your APIs we recommend you use an API client such as Insomnia or Postman, it is easier to call the APIs than with a browser, especially for write actions. As you noticed no password nor authentication process is required to access the APIs which is why you need to be extra careful with you access key rights and how (and to whom) you disclose them. Using your webservice API Describe a resource When you call the root /api url you will get a summary of the available APIs you can call with your access token. In this example we see that we have all rights on the /api/addresses API:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prestashop xmlns:xlink=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;api shopName=\u0026#34;Prestashop\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;addresses xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses\u0026#34; get=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; put=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; post=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; delete=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; head=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses\u0026#34; get=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; put=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; post=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; delete=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; head=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34;\u0026gt; The Customer, Brand and Customer addresses\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;schema xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses?schema=blank\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;blank\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;schema xlink:href=\u0026#34;http://example.com/api/addresses?schema=synopsis\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;synopsis\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/addresses\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/api\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/prestashop\u0026gt; Each API comes with two schema APIs:\n /api/RESOURCE?schema=synopsis returns basic info on the API format, the name of fields and their type /api/RESOURCE?schema=blank will return a default blank data which you could use as a base for your write actions  Both calls are very much alike, only synopsis contains more information about the data format and types:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prestashop xmlns:xlink=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_customer format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_customer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_manufacturer format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_manufacturer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_supplier format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_supplier\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_warehouse format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_warehouse\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_country required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_country\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id_state format=\u0026#34;isNullOrUnsignedId\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/id_state\u0026gt; \u0026lt;alias required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;32\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isGenericName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/alias\u0026gt; \u0026lt;company maxSize=\u0026#34;255\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isGenericName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/company\u0026gt; \u0026lt;lastname required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;255\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/lastname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;firstname required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;255\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/firstname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;vat_number format=\u0026#34;isGenericName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/vat_number\u0026gt; \u0026lt;address1 required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;128\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isAddress\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/address1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;address2 maxSize=\u0026#34;128\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isAddress\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/address2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;postcode maxSize=\u0026#34;12\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isPostCode\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/postcode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;city required=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; maxSize=\u0026#34;64\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isCityName\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/city\u0026gt; \u0026lt;other maxSize=\u0026#34;300\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isMessage\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/other\u0026gt; \u0026lt;phone maxSize=\u0026#34;32\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isPhoneNumber\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/phone\u0026gt; \u0026lt;phone_mobile maxSize=\u0026#34;32\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isPhoneNumber\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/phone_mobile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dni maxSize=\u0026#34;16\u0026#34; format=\u0026#34;isDniLite\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/dni\u0026gt; \u0026lt;deleted format=\u0026#34;isBool\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/deleted\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date_add format=\u0026#34;isDate\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/date_add\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date_upd format=\u0026#34;isDate\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/date_upd\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/address\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/prestashop\u0026gt; Read a resource Each resource comes with an XLink argument.

If you want individual record with specific fields, you need to use both display and filter parameters. A response obtained with \u0026ldquo;display\u0026rdquo; other than \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; can\u0026rsquo;t be used in a PUT (update) request, because the WebserviceRequest class validation for fields is the same for POST (create) and PUT (update).\nThis should be fixed in a near future with a yet-to-come-pull-request introducing the PATCH method!\n Control returned items with \u0026ldquo;filter\u0026rdquo; The EQUAL operator is used when you need to get specific items. For exemple, if you want the addresses for customer #1, you can filter your GET request with the filter parameter: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[id_customer]=1\nThe LIKE operator is used when you need to search for items. For exemple, if you want the addresses with cities starting with \u0026ldquo;SAINT\u0026rdquo;: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[city]=[saint]%\nThe AND operator is used when you need to get items matching several criteria: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[city]=[paris|lyon]\nOther operators can be used, such as:\n NOT EQUAL (single value): http://example.com/api/customers?filter[firstname]=![hubert] (apologies to all Huberts) NOT EQUAL (multiple values): http://example.com/api/customers?filter[firstname]=![hubert|leon|gaspard] (apologies again\u0026hellip;) GREATER THAN: http://example.com/api/customers?filter[birthday]=\u0026gt;[2000-00-00%2000:00:00] (millenials only 🙂) LOWER THAN: http://example.com/api/customers?filter[birthday]=\u0026lt;[2000-00-00%2000:00:00] (previous century only 😄)  This can be used in combination with the display parameter! Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to get the mobile phone numbers of customers #1, #7 and #42: http://example.com/api/addresses?filter[id_customer]=[1|7|42]\u0026amp;display=[phone_mobile]\nYou can also filter by dates! A typical example would be a routine in an ERP fetching the orders since the last call: http://example.com/api/orders?display=full\u0026amp;date=1\u0026amp;filter[date_add]=[2019-11-14%2013:00:00,2019-11-14%2014:00:00]. In this exemple, we request the orders created on 2019-11-14 between 1pm and 2pm.\nPay attention to:\n The url-encoded space (%20) in the datetime values The date=1 parameter used to allow date filtering The dates range, with an inclusive first member and an exclusive last member (from 13:00:00 to 13:59:59)   Special parameters The date=1 parameter must be used to allow date filtering (see exemple above).\nThe limit=0,100 parameter can be used to limit the number of returned items (similar to MySQL\u0026rsquo;s LIMIT clause).\nThe sort=[field1_ASC,field2_DESC] parameter can be used to sort the results (similar to MySQL\u0026rsquo;s ORDER BY clause, with underscore to separate the field name and the order way).\nThe language=1 or language=[1|2] parameter can be used to return only these languages for translatable fields (eg: product description, category name, etc.).\nThe sendemail=1 parameter can be used if you need to change the state of an order AND you want the emails to be sent to the customer: you will have to do a POST on http://example.com/api/order_histories?sendemail=1\nCreate a resource To create a resource, you simply need to GET the XML blank data for the resource (example /api/addresses?schema=blank), fill it with your changes, and send POST HTTP request with the whole XML as body content to the /api/addresses/ URL.\nPrestaShop will take care of adding everything in the database, and will return an XML file indicating that the operation has been successful, along with the ID of the newly created customer.\nUpdate a resource To edit an existing resource: GET the full XML file for the resource you want to change (example /api/addresses/1), edit its content as needed, then send a PUT HTTP request with the whole XML file as a body content to the same URL again.\nUsing JSON instead of XML The Web services can also output JSON instead of XML. To enable JSON output you have two choices:\nQuery parameter Add one of the following parameters to your query string:\n output_format=JSON io_format=JSON  Example:\nhttps://UCCLLQ9N2ARSHWCXLT74KUKSSK34BFKX@example.com/api/?output_format=JSON HTTP header Add the one of the following headers to your HTTP request:\n Io-Format: JSON Output-Format: JSON  Example:\nGET /api/ HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Output-Format: JSON Authorization: Basic VUNDTExROU4yQVJTSFdDWExUNzRLVUtTU0szNEJGS1g6  Note that the API key has been encoded in Base64 for use in headers, as explained in Using an authorization header.

	"title": "How to backup PrestaShop",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "How to backup PrestaShop Important\nIt is strongly recommended not to leave your backups at the root of your store or in another place where could be exposed on publicly.\n Before starting anything, you must think first about safety. Any modification made on a shop could break it, so you must make sure all your data has been backed up before going further. This basically implies saving two things: your files and your database.\nWe will give you all the details you may need to run an upgrade, but we can’t be held responsible for any damage caused to your shop during the process. That’s why we strongly recommend you to follow this backup step.\nFile backup The first elements to backup are the files on the web server where you have deployed your PrestaShop. The PrestaShop folder not only contains the source code, but also your modules \u0026amp; themes, pictures, and all other resources needed to run your shop successfully.\nCopy files To complete this step, your shop folder must be copied somewhere else. Although it can be simply copied on another folder on your server, making an additional copy of your files on another computer is a nice additional security measure. To do so, connect to your server using an FTP, SSH or RDP connection (depending on your server and hosting provider), copy the files in another location, then download them on your computer.\nNote that depending on the number of files and your internet connection, this may take a few hours to complete. But if you’re an advanced user and have a complete access to your server, the next part may help you go faster.\nBonus: Compress your files before download As said before, downloading the whole PrestaShop folder one file at a time will take a long time to complete. If you can run commands on your server, you can make a backup faster by compressing the whole content in a single archive file, then downloading this file locally.\n  On Windows-based servers, this requires a remote desktop access. Once logged on your remote environment, use the Windows explorer to reach your www folder and compress all its content into a ZIP file.\n  On Linux-based servers, you need to access your server terminal using SSH. Once logged in, reach your folder and use the following command to create a TAR file:\n  tar -czf \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt;.tar \u0026lt;folder_to_save\u0026gt; For instance:\ntar -czf backup.tar /var/www/html When your archive is ready, you may copy it on your computer.\nDatabase backup The database on which PrestaShop runs must be saved as well. There are many ways to get a dump of the database content, and we cannot cover all of them. Feel free to use your tools, we just cover the main ones here.

	"content": "How to backup PrestaShop Important\nIt is strongly recommended not to leave your backups at the root of your store or in another place where could be exposed on publicly.\n Before starting anything, you must think first about safety. Any modification made on a shop could break it, so you must make sure all your data has been backed up before going further. This basically implies saving two things: your files and your database.\nWe will give you all the details you may need to run an upgrade, but we can’t be held responsible for any damage caused to your shop during the process. That’s why we strongly recommend you to follow this backup step.\nFile backup The first elements to backup are the files on the web server where you have deployed your PrestaShop. The PrestaShop folder not only contains the source code, but also your modules \u0026amp; themes, pictures, and all other resources needed to run your shop successfully.\nCopy files To complete this step, your shop folder must be copied somewhere else. Although it can be simply copied on another folder on your server, making an additional copy of your files on another computer is a nice additional security measure. To do so, connect to your server using an FTP, SSH or RDP connection (depending on your server and hosting provider), copy the files in another location, then download them on your computer.\nNote that depending on the number of files and your internet connection, this may take a few hours to complete. But if you’re an advanced user and have a complete access to your server, the next part may help you go faster.\nBonus: Compress your files before download As said before, downloading the whole PrestaShop folder one file at a time will take a long time to complete. If you can run commands on your server, you can make a backup faster by compressing the whole content in a single archive file, then downloading this file locally.\n  On Windows-based servers, this requires a remote desktop access. Once logged on your remote environment, use the Windows explorer to reach your www folder and compress all its content into a ZIP file.\n  On Linux-based servers, you need to access your server terminal using SSH. Once logged in, reach your folder and use the following command to create a TAR file:\n  tar -czf \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt;.tar \u0026lt;folder_to_save\u0026gt; For instance:\ntar -czf backup.tar /var/www/html When your archive is ready, you may copy it on your computer.\nDatabase backup The database on which PrestaShop runs must be saved as well. There are many ways to get a dump of the database content, and we cannot cover all of them. Feel free to use your tools, we just cover the main ones here. You can consider your dump is complete when you get a SQL file with the structure AND the content of each table in it.\nUsing MySQL client in command line Using mysqldump is the most straightforward way to make a full backup of a specific database. In a Windows or Linux terminal, run the following command to create a file dump.sql with your database structure \u0026amp; data:\nmysqldump yourdbname \u0026gt; dump.sql With yourdbname an example name for the PrestaShop database.\nYour server is likely to require credentials.

	"content": "How to become a maintainer In the PrestaShop project, maintainers are contributors with merge rights.\nThe maintainer status is a position of great power, but it also carries great responsibility. As gatekeepers to the project\u0026rsquo;s code, maintainers are ultimately responsible for every contribution that is included in the project.\nRequirements to become a maintainer  Active participation in the project  Display a record of several accepted, quality Pull Requests having received little or no objections from maintainers. Display a record of participation in several issues and/or in technical discussions (e.g. Pull Request reviews). Be active in the project’s Slack chat. Real interest in getting involved.   Demonstrate a good level of technical knowledge  Justify a good level of technical skills (SOLID, readable, well-documented, stable, testable code) – in discussions and in code contributions. Display a good understanding of the project, its architecture, its ecosystem, its constraints (transparency, license, backwards compatibility, dependencies, expected behavior\u0026hellip;) Be competent with git and the GitHub workflow (use a fork, be able to rebase, be able to fetch and update a remote branch\u0026hellip;)   Cultural convergence  Respect the Code of Conduct; behave respectfully and in good faith.

How to apply to be a maintainer  Open an issue on the open source repository explaining why you apply to become a maintainer, and on what part of the project (Core or module/subproject). Discuss with current maintainers on this issue; particularly, this will be the time for maintainers to analyze the candidate\u0026rsquo;s motivation and skills on the different parts of the project that they applied for. Once all questions have been answered, current maintainers vote. If the qualified majority of two-thirds positive votes is achieved, the new maintainer is approved.  Upon approval, new maintainer is granted full maintainer rights and accesses for a 90-day trial period. This period aims to provide both the maintainer team and the new maintainer a better understanding of this new arrival and to validate whether expectations meet reality. Both maintainer team or new maintainer can express their wish for this situation to end before the 90-day trial period, revoking the maintainer status.\nAt the end of the 90-day trial period, the maintainer is confirmed in his position.\nHow to lose the maintainer status A project maintainer can be revoked for any of the following reasons:\n Refusal to follow the rules and policies stated in this document. Lack of activity for the past six months. Willful negligence or intent to harm the PrestaShop project. On their demand, for personal reasons.  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Introduction to PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Architecture PrestaShop is a big project, with several moving parts. In this article you will learn how they are structured and how they work together.\nPart of this article was originally published in 2019 as a blog post. It has been updated and adapted for documentation purposes here. Overview  Basic overview of PrestaShop 1.7\u0026#39;s architecture   PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s architecture can be separated in two main logical sections, represented as blue columns in the figure above:\n The Front Office (or \u0026ldquo;FO\u0026rdquo;) – the public-facing site of a shop, The Back Office (or \u0026ldquo;BO\u0026rdquo;) – where merchants manage their shop.  Each of these sections can be themselves separated in two parts, which are common to all web applications:\n The front-end – the part that essentially runs in the browser, The back-end – which runs in the server.  This separation has been depicted using a dotted horizontal line.\nBack-end If we analyze how the back-end is structured, we can find some common elements to BO and FO:\n Database Core Business Modules  Like most traditional web applications, PrestaShop is heavily Database-driven. This means that all data is stored there. Regardless of whether it\u0026rsquo;s used in the BO or FO, the database is the Single Source of Truth.\nIn the figure above, the database has been placed a little outside the diagram to point out to the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a system of its own that could be on a separate server, in a cluster, etc. The purple cloud depicted above the Database is what we call the Core Business. It\u0026rsquo;s the big ensemble of code that manages what makes PrestaShop PrestaShop, also referred as \u0026ldquo;business logic\u0026rdquo;. It includes models, controllers, helper classes, and the like.\nPrestaShop controllers will generally output HTML pages, but on some cases they can output JSON or even XML. The structure of those pages is defined by Themes (depicted as pink blocks overlapping both the front-end and the back-end), which transform controller-provided data into HTML. This is true both for the FO and BO.\nAlthough PrestaShop 1.7 is bundled with default themes for FO and BO, only the FO supports third-party themes.\nPrestaShop provides two API interfaces:\n BO API – used to serve information to VueJS-based pages (currently Translations and Stock management), Web services – used to integrate 3rd party services.  While Web services can output XML or JSON data, the BO API is JSON-only.\nFinally, Modules are independent, optional packages that can extend and customize PrestaShop in many ways. They interact with the Core either by hooking into extension points which are placed throughout the code, or by replacing core components with their own.\nWhile in this diagram we have placed Modules on the Back-end side, they can actually have an impact on Front-end as well. Front-end On the front side, implementations can vary a lot depending on the theme. Some themes are HTML-based and rely on little amount of scripting. Other themes are more advanced and Javascript-heavy.\nThis is discussed in further detail in the Themes section.\nThe Core Business stack While controllers will be different in BO and FO, pretty much all of PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s PHP code is shared between those two environments. This code is split in four logical subsystems:\n Legacy code – located in /classes and /controllers Core code – located in /src/Core Adapter code – located in /src/Adapter Symfony code (or \u0026ldquo;PrestaShop Bundle\u0026rdquo;) – located in /src/PrestaShopBundle  The Legacy subsystem contains the historical, non-namespaced code inherited from previous versions. It\u0026rsquo;s progressively being replaced since 1.6.1 by the Core subsystem, which uses namespaces and is based on SOLID principles.\nThe Adapter subsystem acts as a bridge to legacy classes, which are often static, in order to allow them to be injected in Core classes.\nFinally, the Symfony-based subsystem called PrestaShop Bundle is a Symfony bundle that contains Symfony-specific functionality like controllers, forms, views, etc.\nIn the following figure, we can appreciate the four subsystems described above:\n The core business stack   Interaction between subsystems While this separation may seem excessively complex, it belongs to a transition phase that is necessary to allow the project to move forward progressively. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nNotice the dotted yellow zone labeled temporary code. It means that code within that zone will sooner or later be moved to the Core or PrestaShop Bundle stack. Once the zone it\u0026rsquo;s empty, it will be deleted. Of course, such a change won\u0026rsquo;t be done in a minor version, so you can expect these four stacks to be present for the whole lifetime of 1.7.\nIf you look closely at the relationships between each stack, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that code outside the temporary code zone does not interact directly with legacy classes. As explained before, the Adapter layer sits between the Legacy and the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; code to ease up the transition of code from the Legacy stack to the Core stack.\nHow does that work? Whenever a Core (or PrestaShopBundle) class needs something provided by a Legacy class, instead of using the Legacy class directly, it delegates that task to an Adapter, which itself uses the Legacy class (see Adapter pattern).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting. Generally, these Adapters implement an interface declared in Core (even though it hasn\u0026rsquo;t always been the case, new classes do). Making consumers of that Adapter depend on the interface instead of the Adapter class itself (see Dependency Inversion principle) will allow to reimplement Adapter classes in Core progressively, without having to change the existing code that depends on them.\nWhy not use the Legacy class directly?\nMost legacy classes are static, and since by definition they cannot be injected, it would result in coupled, untestable code. In addition, the ones that are not static generally still have too many responsibilities (see Single responsibility principle) and/or too many public methods or properties (see Open/closed principle), so they cannot be made to implement a proper interface.\n Controllers PrestaShop is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where Controllers are in charge of handling requests and returning responses, ideally delegating the hard work on dedicated services.\nControllers are divided in two big families: those that handle requests in FO, and those that handle requests in BO.\n Core controllers   Controllers can belong to either the Legacy subsystem or to the PrestaShop Bundle. The first ones are referred to as \u0026ldquo;legacy controllers\u0026rdquo; and the latter as \u0026ldquo;Symfony controllers\u0026rdquo;. However, Symfony controllers are only available in BO.\nFO Controllers FO controllers are all based on the FrontController class. Modules can declare FO controllers of their own, which must extend the ModuleFrontController class (which is based on FrontController as well).\nBO Controllers BO controllers are a little more complex, since they can be either legacy or Symfony based.\nLegacy BO controllers are based on the AdminController class, whereas Symfony controllers are based on the FrameworkBundleAdminController class. Modules can declare BO controllers of their own, and they can be either legacy or symfony based as well. Legacy module controllers must extend the ModuleAdminController class (which is based on AdminController), and Symfony modules must simply extend FrameworkBundleAdminController.\nFinally, some BO pages like Stocks and Translation are API based. These controllers are based on the ApiController class.\nAs the migration to Symfony progresses, legacy BO controllers are being migrated from the legacy stack to the PrestaShop Bundle stack. Once the BO migration is complete, there will no longer be any legacy controller in the BO.\nThere are no controllers for Web services. This system is mainly configuration-based and very tightly coupled to ObjectModel. Comparison table    Family Subsystem Type Base controller class     FO Legacy Native FrontController   Module ModuleFrontController (based on FrontController)   BO Legacy Native AdminController   Module ModuleAdminController (based on AdminController)   Symfony Native FrameworkBundleAdminController   Native (BO API) ApiController   Module FrameworkBundleAdminController    Themes Legacy controllers use Smarty for templating, while Symfony controllers use Twig.\nThere are two kinds of themes in PrestaShop: FO themes and BO themes.\nFO themes FO themes define the appearance of the Front Office.\nPrestaShop comes bundled with a default FO theme, called \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo;, but merchant can choose to use a different theme. Hundreds of them are available for download on the Addons Marketplace.\nSince FO themes work on top of legacy controllers, they are based on the Smarty templating engine. They all integrate a shared core javascript library which is called core.js, which has jQuery 3 bundled in (or jQuery 2 before 1.7.7  ).\nClassic is based on Bootstrap 4 alpha 5. A great number of themes are based on it using the Child theme feature.\nUnfortunately, Classic cannot be updated to recent Bootstrap versions due to big breaking changes introduced by Bootstrap since the original release of PrestaShop 1.7.0. Additionally, FO themes can redefine the layout of modules by overriding their templates.\nBO themes BO themes define the appearance of the Back Office.\nEven though BO themes are not interchangeable, PrestaShop comes bundled with two of them: default and new theme.\nSo why are there two? Legacy controllers are based on Smarty, like FO controller. Symfony controllers, conversely, are based on the Twig templating engine. As a result, there\u0026rsquo;s a theme for each one: legacy controllers use the default theme, while Symfony ones use the new theme. As controllers are progressively being migrated to Symfony, templates are moved from the default to the new theme and converted from Smarty to Twig.\nIn addition, the default theme is based on Bootstrap 3, while the new theme is based on PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s UI kit (available on GitHub), which itself is based on Bootstrap 4. They both integrate jQuery 3 since 1.7.7  .\nOn previous 1.7 versions, the default theme was based on jQuery 1. Mixed Smarty and Twig Here\u0026rsquo;s what was said when announcing the architecture of 1.7:\n Twig is Symfony\u0026rsquo;s templating language. In version 1.7, it will be used for all pages that are rewritten to use Symfony [\u0026hellip;], but NOT for the global interface (menu, header, etc.) nor the non-rewritten pages, which will still use Smarty. The two templating engines will be available, side by side, during the transition phase.\n This means that the global interface is handled by the default theme, even in Symfony pages. Because they use both Twig and Smarty, this partially explains why some Symfony pages may sometimes be slower than legacy ones.\nRest assured, this is a temporary issue which will be solved when everything has been migrated to Twig and Symfony.\n Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s Vue pages. Vue pages are hybrid: half-Symfony, half-API based BO pages. In those pages, the page\u0026rsquo;s skeleton is first rendered by a Symfony controller (therefore, based on the new theme), and then a VueJS application takes over in the browser and draws its content based on data sent by the BO API.\nAs stated before, currently only the Stock management and Translation pages are built on this technology. Even though we think that this is the way of the future, we find that going down this path in minor version releases would produce too many major extensibility and backwards incompatibility issues. Therefore, there will probably be no new Vue/BO API pages in 1.7.\nModules The Modules system provides a plug-in approach to added functionality. As explained before, it mainly relies on specific extension points called \u0026ldquo;Hooks,\u0026rdquo; but their influence and deeply rooted relationships can go much further than that.\nIf you look at the Modules block at the center of the figure at the top of the page, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that there are lots of arrows coming and going from it. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore these relationships.\nLike we said, the main path for Module integration is Hooks, which are placed throughout the system. Modules can attach to them in order to provide or alter features.\nThere are two types of hooks:\n Display hooks – Integrated mainly (but not exclusively) in templates, they allow modules to inject content that will be displayed somewhere in a page. Action hooks – Allow modules to be informed of something happening in the system, and optionally alter the system\u0026rsquo;s behavior by modifying provided data.  The module system provides several other features:\n Module controllers – Modules can add new routes and custom pages in the FO or BO. Payment options – Payment modules can add payment options in the checkout process. Declaring and sharing services – Since 1.7.4, modules can use and declare Symfony services.  Modules can also be used to customize PrestaShop:\n Class override system – This system allows a module to replace any class in the Legacy stack. BO template overrides – Allows to replace templates from the new theme in the BO. Service overrides – Since 1.7.4, modules can replace Core services with their own. CSS and JS injection – Modules can also inject style and javascript code into a page.  In addition, modules can be customized by Themes. Themes supporting a given module can override the module\u0026rsquo;s own FO templates in order to improve their integration.\nAs you can see, the module system has many features, making modules very powerful. Modules have full access to the Core system, and even if modules submitted to the Addons Marketplace go through a quality and security review process, integration can go very deep into the Core. This power comes with a cost: the deeper the integration and customization, the more risk of upgrade and interoperability issues there is.\nDetailed diagram Now you know PrestaShop is much more complex than it can seem to be at first sight.\nRemember the overview at the top of the article?

	"content": "Introduction to PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Architecture PrestaShop is a big project, with several moving parts. In this article you will learn how they are structured and how they work together.\nPart of this article was originally published in 2019 as a blog post. It has been updated and adapted for documentation purposes here. Overview  Basic overview of PrestaShop 8\u0026#39;s architecture   PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s architecture can be separated in two main logical sections, represented as blue columns in the figure above:\n The Front Office (or \u0026ldquo;FO\u0026rdquo;) – the public-facing site of a shop, The Back Office (or \u0026ldquo;BO\u0026rdquo;) – where merchants manage their shop.  Each of these sections can be themselves separated in two parts, which are common to all web applications:\n The front-end – the part that essentially runs in the browser, The back-end – which runs in the server.  This separation has been depicted using a dotted horizontal line.\nBack-end If we analyze how the back-end is structured, we can find some common elements to BO and FO:\n Database Core Business Modules  Like most traditional web applications, PrestaShop is heavily Database-driven. This means that all data is stored there. Regardless of whether it\u0026rsquo;s used in the BO or FO, the database is the Single Source of Truth.\nIn the figure above, the database has been placed a little outside the diagram to point out to the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a system of its own that could be on a separate server, in a cluster, etc. The purple cloud depicted above the Database is what we call the Core Business. It\u0026rsquo;s the big ensemble of code that manages what makes PrestaShop PrestaShop, also referred as \u0026ldquo;business logic\u0026rdquo;. It includes models, controllers, helper classes, and the like.\nPrestaShop controllers will generally output HTML pages, but on some cases they can output JSON or even XML. The structure of those pages is defined by Themes (depicted as pink blocks overlapping both the front-end and the back-end), which transform controller-provided data into HTML. This is true both for the FO and BO.\nAlthough PrestaShop 8 is bundled with default themes for FO and BO, only the FO supports third-party themes.\nPrestaShop provides two API interfaces:\n BO API – used to serve information to VueJS-based pages (currently Translations and Stock management), Web services – used to integrate 3rd party services.  While Web services can output XML or JSON data, the BO API is JSON-only.\nFinally, Modules are independent, optional packages that can extend and customize PrestaShop in many ways. They interact with the Core either by hooking into extension points which are placed throughout the code, or by replacing core components with their own.\nWhile in this diagram we have placed Modules on the Back-end side, they can actually have an impact on Front-end as well. Front-end On the front side, implementations can vary a lot depending on the theme. Some themes are HTML-based and rely on little amount of scripting. Other themes are more advanced and Javascript-heavy.\nThis is discussed in further detail in the Themes section.\nThe Core Business stack While controllers will be different in BO and FO, pretty much all of PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s PHP code is shared between those two environments. This code is split in four logical subsystems:\n Legacy code – located in /classes and /controllers Core code – located in /src/Core Adapter code – located in /src/Adapter Symfony code (or \u0026ldquo;PrestaShop Bundle\u0026rdquo;) – located in /src/PrestaShopBundle  The Legacy subsystem contains the historical, non-namespaced code inherited from previous versions. It\u0026rsquo;s progressively being replaced since 1.6.1 by the Core subsystem, which uses namespaces and is based on SOLID principles.\nThe Adapter subsystem acts as a bridge to legacy classes, which are often static, in order to allow them to be injected in Core classes.\nFinally, the Symfony-based subsystem called PrestaShop Bundle is a Symfony bundle that contains Symfony-specific functionality like controllers, forms, views, etc.\nIn the following figure, we can appreciate the four subsystems described above:\n The core business stack   Interaction between subsystems While this separation may seem excessively complex, it belongs to a transition phase that is necessary to allow the project to move forward progressively. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nNotice the dotted yellow zone labeled temporary code. It means that code within that zone will sooner or later be moved to the Core or PrestaShop Bundle stack. Once the zone it\u0026rsquo;s empty, it will be deleted. Of course, such a change won\u0026rsquo;t be done in a minor version, so you can expect these four stacks to be present for the whole lifetime of PrestaShop 8.\nIf you look closely at the relationships between each stack, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that code outside the temporary code zone does not interact directly with legacy classes. As explained before, the Adapter layer sits between the Legacy and the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; code to ease up the transition of code from the Legacy stack to the Core stack.\nHow does that work? Whenever a Core (or PrestaShopBundle) class needs something provided by a Legacy class, instead of using the Legacy class directly, it delegates that task to an Adapter, which itself uses the Legacy class (see Adapter pattern).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting. Generally, these Adapters implement an interface declared in Core (even though it hasn\u0026rsquo;t always been the case, new classes do). Making consumers of that Adapter depend on the interface instead of the Adapter class itself (see Dependency Inversion principle) will allow to reimplement Adapter classes in Core progressively, without having to change the existing code that depends on them.\nWhy not use the Legacy class directly?\nMost legacy classes are static, and since by definition they cannot be injected, it would result in coupled, untestable code. In addition, the ones that are not static generally still have too many responsibilities (see Single responsibility principle) and/or too many public methods or properties (see Open/closed principle), so they cannot be made to implement a proper interface.\n Controllers PrestaShop is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where Controllers are in charge of handling requests and returning responses, ideally delegating the hard work on dedicated services.\nControllers are divided in two big families: those that handle requests in FO, and those that handle requests in BO.\n Core controllers   Controllers can belong to either the Legacy subsystem or to the PrestaShop Bundle. The first ones are referred to as \u0026ldquo;legacy controllers\u0026rdquo; and the latter as \u0026ldquo;Symfony controllers\u0026rdquo;. However, Symfony controllers are only available in BO.\nFO Controllers FO controllers are all based on the FrontController class. Modules can declare FO controllers of their own, which must extend the ModuleFrontController class (which is based on FrontController as well).\nBO Controllers BO controllers are a little more complex, since they can be either legacy or Symfony based.\nLegacy BO controllers are based on the AdminController class, whereas Symfony controllers are based on the FrameworkBundleAdminController class. Modules can declare BO controllers of their own, and they can be either legacy or symfony based as well. Legacy module controllers must extend the ModuleAdminController class (which is based on AdminController), and Symfony modules must simply extend FrameworkBundleAdminController.\nFinally, some BO pages like Stocks and Translation are API based. These controllers are based on the ApiController class.\nAs the migration to Symfony progresses, legacy BO controllers are being migrated from the legacy stack to the PrestaShop Bundle stack. Once the BO migration is complete, there will no longer be any legacy controller in the BO.\nThere are no controllers for Web services. This system is mainly configuration-based and very tightly coupled to ObjectModel. Comparison table    Family Subsystem Type Base controller class     FO Legacy Native FrontController   Module ModuleFrontController (based on FrontController)   BO Legacy Native AdminController   Module ModuleAdminController (based on AdminController)   Symfony Native FrameworkBundleAdminController   Native (BO API) ApiController   Module FrameworkBundleAdminController    Themes Legacy controllers use Smarty for templating, while Symfony controllers use Twig.\nThere are two kinds of themes in PrestaShop: FO themes and BO themes.\nFO themes FO themes define the appearance of the Front Office.\nPrestaShop comes bundled with a default FO theme, called \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo;, but merchant can choose to use a different theme. Hundreds of them are available for download on the Addons Marketplace.\nSince FO themes work on top of legacy controllers, they are based on the Smarty templating engine. They all integrate a shared core javascript library which is called core.js, which has jQuery 3 bundled in.\nClassic is based on Bootstrap 4 alpha 5. A great number of themes are based on it using the Child theme feature.\nUnfortunately, Classic cannot be updated to recent Bootstrap versions due to big breaking changes introduced by Bootstrap since the original release of PrestaShop 1.7.0. Additionally, FO themes can redefine the layout of modules by overriding their templates.\nBO themes BO themes define the appearance of the Back Office.\nEven though BO themes are not interchangeable, PrestaShop comes bundled with two of them: default and new theme.\nSo why are there two? Legacy controllers are based on Smarty, like FO controller. Symfony controllers, conversely, are based on the Twig templating engine. As a result, there\u0026rsquo;s a theme for each one: legacy controllers use the default theme, while Symfony ones use the new theme.

They both integrate jQuery 3.\nMixed Smarty and Twig Here\u0026rsquo;s what was said when announcing the architecture of 1.7:\n Twig is Symfony\u0026rsquo;s templating language. In version 1.7, it will be used for all pages that are rewritten to use Symfony [\u0026hellip;], but NOT for the global interface (menu, header, etc.) nor the non-rewritten pages, which will still use Smarty. The two templating engines will be available, side by side, during the transition phase.\n This means that the global interface is handled by the default theme, even in Symfony pages. Because they use both Twig and Smarty, this partially explains why some Symfony pages may sometimes be slower than legacy ones.\nRest assured, this is a temporary issue which will be solved when everything has been migrated to Twig and Symfony.\n Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s Vue pages.

Even though we think that this is the way of the future, we find that going down this path in minor version releases would produce too many major extensibility and backwards incompatibility issues. Therefore, there will probably be no new Vue/BO API pages in PrestaShop 8.\nModules The Modules system provides a plug-in approach to added functionality.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "This is a summary of the current Migration Strategy. It provides an overview of our current vision, in the end of this year 2020, of the Symfony Migration project.\nDifferent kind of pages Back-Office pages can be classified in four categories:\n Configuration / Settings Form pages  These pages allow the user to modify configuration settings in PrestaShop.\nListing pages  These pages allow the user to browse PrestaShop content using listings. These listings usually provide some actions the user can trigger, such as \u0026ldquo;enable/disable\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;delete\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bulk delete\u0026rdquo;.\nAdd/Edit Form pages  These pages allow the user to create or edit records from PrestaShop data model (example: create/edit customers).\nOther pages  There are some pages that are unique: Carriers Edit page, Dashboard, Customer Service page \u0026hellip;\nSometimes a page will have mixed content. For example there are pages that provide two listings or one listing and one configuration form.\nWhere we started from In legacy pages, most of the time, these Back-office pages were structured following standard MVC PrestaShop model:\n smarty templates (View) a Controller with sometimes a lot of logic in it (Controller) some business logic classes (Model) ObjectModel classes with lot of logic in it (Model)  We believe PrestaShop project has grown too big to follow this 3-layers model, rather fitted for small applications. We have chosen to introduce more architecture layers.\nThe beginning of the Migration project: Configuration Form The Migration project started by migrating Configuration Form pages.\nThe chosen structure to handle such pages was the following:\n A View layer: Twig template, rendering manually the Symfony form A Controller layer: Symfony Controller empty of business logic (following the \u0026ldquo;Thin Controller, Fat Model\u0026rdquo; principle), in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing In Model layer: Symfony Form is built and managed by a FormHandler Also part of the Model layer, DataProvider is in charge of data retrieval and saving the data  Since the DataProvider interacts with ObjectModel, it belongs to Adapter namespace.\nPhase 2: listings For migrating Listing pages, the Grid component was built.\nThe chosen layer structure to handle such pages was the following:\n View layer: Twig template, using Grid Twig template Symfony Controller layer empty of business logic, in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing In Application layer, we have the Grid component which requires a GridDefinition configures the Grid and a GridFactory to build it Data is provided by a QueryBuilder, able to handle filters for search requests. This is the Model layer.  If the Grid provides some actions, they are handled by dedicated Controller Actions.\nHow Grid interacts with the legacy Model The QueryBuilder ignores ObjectModel and use a Doctrine Connection to query directly the database. So there is no interaction with legacy code.\nHowever the Grid Actions use ObjectModel, for example to enable/disable a Category status. In the beginning we used Adapter classes to handle these, but we could see that once again we were coupling legacy code with migrated code.\nThis is when we decided to introduce CQRS.\nPhase 3: CQRS We wanted to build a strong frontier between migrated code and legacy code. Since re-writing all the code would be too long, we needed to continue relying on the business logic legacy code to power PrestaShop.\nWe however wanted to interact with it in a way that would allow us, in the future, to easily unplug it and replace it with a new implementation.\nSo we decided to introduce CQRS and a Domain.\nCQRS was introduced into PrestaShop architecture in the following manner:\nThe Application layer (Forms, Controllers, Views \u0026hellip;) dispatches Queries and Commands to the Domain to be handled, unaware of the inner workings of this domain.\nInside the domain are QueryHandlers and CommandHandlers that handle dispatched Queries and Commands. For now, they do use PrestaShop legacy business logic to handle it. This means classes like ObjectModel, Cart, Product are still being used inside migrated pages.\nThe communication between the two layers is performed by CommandBus and QueryBus, which carry the Commands and Queries.\nSince the Handlers use legacy logic, they belong to the Adapter namespace. In the future they will be replaced with new implementations. The replacement will be very easy: a new Handler will be plugged in, previous Handler will be removed. No modification will be required in the code.\nSo the structure for a Grid action, using CQRS, is the following:\n Symfony Controller layer empty of business logic, in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing The Controller dispatches a Command to perform the action Command goes through the CommandBus and is handled by a Handler Handler, in Domain (= Model layer) performs the business logic needed  So \u0026ldquo;migrating a Grid action\u0026rdquo; means to \u0026ldquo;move the legacy logic into a Handler and building a Symfony layer on top of it\u0026rdquo;\nPhase 4 : Add/Edit Form pages These pages are form leveraging the concepts of CQRS.\nYou can read more about it by clicking on this link.\n View layer: Twig template, rendering manually the Symfony form Symfony Controller layer empty of business logic, in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing Application layer:   Symfony Form is built by a FormBuilder and managed by a FormHandler a FormDataProvider is in charge of data retrieval a FormDataHandler is in charge of validating and dispatching a Command to perform the action  Domain / Model layer:   Command goes through the CommandBus and is handled by a Handler Handler performs the business logic needed  So \u0026ldquo;migrating a legacy Add/Edit page\u0026rdquo; means to \u0026ldquo;move the legacy logic into a Handler and building a Symfony Form on top of it with its management logic\u0026rdquo;.\nForm Theme We dont want to render manually Form inputs, so we now aim to build a Twig Form Theme allowing us to render all of our Symfony forms with a single block\n{{ form_widget(form) }} Towards a Core domain Between phase 1 and phase 4, two years passed. Two years where we experimented, explored, struggled and we got the hang of what was needed for PrestaShop to move forward.\nWe now have a better understanding of what the direction we are aiming for. We now know we want to build a full Core Domain for the future of PrestaShop.\nThe future PrestaShop architecture is based on 5 key elements:\n Future architecture overview    Core Domain Front-end applications Contracts and Tools (SDKs) APIs Extensions  The Core sits in the back-end and is at the center of it all. It accounts for all the business needs and use cases that PrestaShop is capable of doing (managing products, shopping carts, orders, etc.). The Core is domain-oriented, meaning that it is built around business use cases, expressed in an ubiquitous language. The Core is also master of its own Domain; in order to let it be the guardian of system-wide coherence, it has to be isolated from other services and be the only one capable of performing state transitions. Other services can only interact with the Core through well-defined interfaces, that we call the Core API. Incidentally, this also means that Core behavior can be extended, not modified, by other services or at least not in a way that it puts system coherence at risk. In addition, the Core is designed to be easily testable and is covered by automated tests.\nIn the future architecture, the Back Office (BO) and the Front Office (FO) are independent front-end applications, each one running entirely on the browser. They are fully component-based (our framework of choice is VueJs, and built using separate toolsets called Software Development Kits (SDKs): one for the FO, one for the BO. These SDKs would not only include reusable components, but also bidirectional communication channels based on stable contracts, both within the front-end application (events) as well as with the back-end (through APIs). The BO SDK also integrates the UI Kit, which provides an uniform style for the whole Back Office.\nThe Core and FO/BO applications communicate through two separate APIs, namely the FO API and the BO API. These APIs serve two distinct purposes: while the FO API is public and designed to serve customer-facing applications (e.g. the FO application, but also other custom clients, like mobile apps or Point of Sales in physical stores), the BO API is protected by access rights (much like the current Web services) and is meant to power the BO application, as well as third party integrations like ERPs. In order to maximize forward compatibility, APIs and SDKs are versioned.\nOf course, the future architecture supports Extensions, which can be placed all over the system. Modules can hook on to existing features or add new ones, either on the front-end applications as well as in the back-end (for data processing). On the front-end, Modules are based on the FO/BO SDKs, whereas server-side they are built on top of the Back-end SDK. While Front-end SDKs allow Modules to interact with front-end applications and retrieve data through PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s APIs, the Back-end SDK provides access to the Core API, which allows Modules to query data directly from the Core, perform state transitions, extend existing API endpoints and even create new ones. In order to ensure system stability, Extensions can only interact with PrestaShop through APIs and SDKs.\nFinally, Themes are a particular kind of extension that sits on top of the front-end application and that defines the layout and style for components provided by the application, FO SDK, and any installed Modules.\nMigration as an introduction to the Core Our Handlers started as \u0026ldquo;place where we put the legacy code we dont have the time to migrate now\u0026rdquo;. They must now become interfaces for the Core domain, defining the future API endpoints. You could think of them as Controllers for the Domain, and consequently they will become empty of business logic, only focused on validating incoming Commands and Queries and formatting the data in both directions.\n"

	"content": "This is a summary of the current Migration Strategy. It provides an overview of our current vision, in the end of this year 2020, of the Symfony Migration project.\nDifferent kind of pages Back-Office pages can be classified in four categories:\n Configuration / Settings Form pages  These pages allow the user to modify configuration settings in PrestaShop.\nListing pages  These pages allow the user to browse PrestaShop content using listings. These listings usually provide some actions the user can trigger, such as \u0026ldquo;enable/disable\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;delete\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bulk delete\u0026rdquo;.\nAdd/Edit Form pages  These pages allow the user to create or edit records from PrestaShop data model (example: create/edit customers).\nOther pages  There are some pages that are unique: Carriers Edit page, Dashboard, Customer Service page \u0026hellip;\nSometimes a page will have mixed content. For example there are pages that provide two listings or one listing and one configuration form.\nWhere we started from In legacy pages, most of the time, these Back-office pages were structured following standard MVC PrestaShop model:\n smarty templates (View) a Controller with sometimes a lot of logic in it (Controller) some business logic classes (Model) ObjectModel classes with lot of logic in it (Model)  We believe PrestaShop project has grown too big to follow this 3-layers model, rather fitted for small applications. We have chosen to introduce more architecture layers.\nThe beginning of the Migration project: Configuration Form The Migration project started by migrating Configuration Form pages.\nThe chosen structure to handle such pages was the following:\n A View layer: Twig template, rendering manually the Symfony form A Controller layer: Symfony Controller empty of business logic (following the \u0026ldquo;Thin Controller, Fat Model\u0026rdquo; principle), in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing In Model layer: Symfony Form is built and managed by a FormHandler Also part of the Model layer, DataProvider is in charge of data retrieval and saving the data  Since the DataProvider interacts with ObjectModel, it belongs to Adapter namespace.\nPhase 2: listings For migrating Listing pages, the Grid component was built.\nThe chosen layer structure to handle such pages was the following:\n View layer: Twig template, using Grid Twig template Symfony Controller layer empty of business logic, in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing In Application layer, we have the Grid component which requires a GridDefinition configures the Grid and a GridFactory to build it Data is provided by a QueryBuilder, able to handle filters for search requests. This is the Model layer.  If the Grid provides some actions, they are handled by dedicated Controller Actions.\nHow Grid interacts with the legacy Model The QueryBuilder ignores ObjectModel and use a Doctrine Connection to query directly the database. So there is no interaction with legacy code.\nHowever the Grid Actions use ObjectModel, for example to enable/disable a Category status. In the beginning we used Adapter classes to handle these, but we could see that once again we were coupling legacy code with migrated code.\nThis is when we decided to introduce CQRS.\nPhase 3: CQRS We wanted to build a strong frontier between migrated code and legacy code. Since re-writing all the code would be too long, we needed to continue relying on the business logic legacy code to power PrestaShop.\nWe however wanted to interact with it in a way that would allow us, in the future, to easily unplug it and replace it with a new implementation.\nSo we decided to introduce CQRS and a Domain.\nCQRS was introduced into PrestaShop architecture in the following manner:\nThe Application layer (Forms, Controllers, Views \u0026hellip;) dispatches Queries and Commands to the Domain to be handled, unaware of the inner workings of this domain.\nInside the domain are QueryHandlers and CommandHandlers that handle dispatched Queries and Commands. For now, they do use PrestaShop legacy business logic to handle it. This means classes like ObjectModel, Cart, Product are still being used inside migrated pages.\nThe communication between the two layers is performed by CommandBus and QueryBus, which carry the Commands and Queries.\nSince the Handlers use legacy logic, they belong to the Adapter namespace. In the future they will be replaced with new implementations. The replacement will be very easy: a new Handler will be plugged in, previous Handler will be removed. No modification will be required in the code.\nSo the structure for a Grid action, using CQRS, is the following:\n Symfony Controller layer empty of business logic, in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing The Controller dispatches a Command to perform the action Command goes through the CommandBus and is handled by a Handler Handler, in Domain (= Model layer) performs the business logic needed  So \u0026ldquo;migrating a Grid action\u0026rdquo; means to \u0026ldquo;move the legacy logic into a Handler and building a Symfony layer on top of it\u0026rdquo;\nPhase 4 : Add/Edit Form pages These pages are form leveraging the concepts of CQRS.\nYou can read more about it by clicking on this link.\n View layer: Twig template, rendering manually the Symfony form Symfony Controller layer empty of business logic, in charge of controlling the View, formatting data, handling security and routing Application layer:   Symfony Form is built by a FormBuilder and managed by a FormHandler a FormDataProvider is in charge of data retrieval a FormDataHandler is in charge of validating and dispatching a Command to perform the action  Domain / Model layer:   Command goes through the CommandBus and is handled by a Handler Handler performs the business logic needed  So \u0026ldquo;migrating a legacy Add/Edit page\u0026rdquo; means to \u0026ldquo;move the legacy logic into a Handler and building a Symfony Form on top of it with its management logic\u0026rdquo;.\nForm Theme We dont want to render manually Form inputs, so we now aim to build a Twig Form Theme allowing us to render all of our Symfony forms with a single block\n{{ form_widget(form) }} Towards a Core domain Between phase 1 and phase 4, two years passed. Two years where we experimented, explored, struggled and we got the hang of what was needed for PrestaShop to move forward.\nWe now have a better understanding of what the direction we are aiming for.

They are identified by an additional id attribute in XML, which is the same as its name.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entity_hook\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fields id=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field name=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field name=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;field name=\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/fields\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entities\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hook id=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/hook\u0026gt; \u0026lt;hook id=\u0026#34;actionMaintenancePageFormSave\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;actionMaintenancePageFormSave\u0026lt;/name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Processing Maintenance page form\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;description\u0026gt;This hook is called when the Maintenance Page form is processed\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/hook\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/entities\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/entity_hook\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xml\u0026gt;  Always add new hooks at the bottom of the list, as hooks are registered sequentially. Prepare database update for auto upgrades The last step is to describe the update process for the auto upgrade module – essentially, the insertion of new hooks in hooks table. Locate the X.Y.Z.sql file that refers to the PrestaShop version that will include your change: for instance, if the release expected to include this change is 1.7.5.0, locate that file in install-dev/upgrade/sql folder.\nThis process is explained here: Structure and content upgrades Then add the corresponding SQL commands to add new hooks:\nINSERTIGNOREINTO`PREFIX_hook`(`id_hook`,`name`,`title`,`description`,`position`)VALUES(NULL,\u0026#39;displayAdministrationPageForm\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Manage Administration Page form fields\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;This hook adds, update or remove fields of the Administration Page form\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;),(NULL,\u0026#39;actionMaintenancePageFormSave\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;Processing Maintenance page form\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;This hook is called when the Maintenance Page form is processed\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;);"

	"content": "Templating with Twig This is mostly the easy part. Legacy pages use Smarty while modern pages use Twig. These templating engines are actually similar in many ways.\nFor instance, this is a legacy template:\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;employee_avatar_small\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img class=\u0026#34;img\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;{$employee_image}\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {$employee_name}  All of the legacy templates are located in the admin-dev/themes/default/template/controller folder \u0026hellip; and here is a possible migration of it to Twig:\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;employee_avatar_small\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img class=\u0026#34;img\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;{{ employee.name }}\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;{{ employee.image }}\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{ employee.name }}The syntax of both engines is really similar. Find out more about Twig by reading the Twig documentation.\nHelpers All our custom helpers have been ported from Smarty to Twig:\n   Smarty Twig     { l s='foo' d='domain' } {{ 'foo'|trans({}, 'domain') }}    { hook h='hookName' } {{ renderhook('hookName') }}   {$link-\u0026gt;getAdminLink('AdminAccess')} {{ getAdminLink('LegacyControllerName') }}    Macros Macros/functions are specific to the modern pages to help with recurrent blocks:\n form_label_tooltip(name, tooltip, placement) Renders a form label (by name) with an informational tooltip on rollover. check(variable) Checks if a variable is defined and not empty. tooltip(text, icon, position) Renders a tooltip with information in roll hover (doesn\u0026rsquo;t render a label). infotip(text)\\ warningtip(text) Renders information and warning tips (more like alert messages). label_with_help(label, help) Renders a label with a help box beside it.   Bootstrap Legacy templates use Bootstrap 3 while modern pages use the PrestaShop UI Kit that is based on Bootstrap 4. This means that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to update some markup (especially CSS classes).\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with Bootstrap 4, check out their article on migrating to v4, which explains the major changes from v3 to v4. jQuery Since we use the jQuery version that is bundled with Bootstrap, old pages use jQuery 1.11 and new ones jQuery 3.3. In addition to this, javascript from old pages was included as separate files without any compilation, while new pages we use modules which are compiled and bundled using Webpack.\nDepending on the page you are migrating, this task may be straightforward or more complex.\nTranslations Be careful when copying translatable wordings, you must use the exact same strings in order to keep the translation working. Example:\n\u0026lt;?php // legacy controller $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Before activating the webservice, you must be sure to: \u0026#39;, array(), \u0026#39;Admin.Advparameters.Help\u0026#39;); \u0026hellip; must become:\n{{ \u0026#39;Before activating the webservice, you must be sure to: \u0026#39;|trans({}, \u0026#39;Admin.Advparameters.Help\u0026#39;) }}Manage modern assets with Webpack PrestaShop uses Webpack to build and bundle static assets in PrestaShop, like Javascript and stylesheets.\nThe root folder for the modern theme is /admin-dev/themes/new-theme.

It covers the features of PrestaShop and grows each time a bug is resolved or a feature is added.\nThese tests are launched every time a change is suggested to the core, but you can also run them with your module installed. This will ensure your module code does not break a critical feature of the core.\nThis section will be completed when these tests will be available on a dedicated repository. In the meantime you can already reach them on GitHub, in the tests/puppeteer folder of PrestaShop files.\n"

Another advantage is that a local test environment enables you to test code without the risk of breaking your production store. Have a local environment is the essential first step in the path of web development.\nPrerequisites Read System Requirements.\nInstalling a local environment Installing any web-application locally requires that you first install the adequate environment, namely the Apache web server, the PHP language interpreter, the MySQL database server, and ideally a MySQL admin tool such as phpMyAdmin tool.\nThis is called an *AMP package: Apache+MySQL+PHP and the operating system, giving WAMP (Windows+Apache+MySQL+PHP), MAMP (Mac OS X+…) and LAMP (Linux+…). Since all of the items packaged are open-source, these installers are most of the time free.\nHere is a selection of free AMP installers:\n XAMPP (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris) WampServer (Windows) EasyPHP (Windows) MAMP (Windows, Mac OS X) Laragon (Windows)  To install LAMP on your computer follow these steps (tested on Debian Buster).\n Update your system  apt update   Install MySQL  apt install default-mysql-server default-mysql-client   Install Apache server  apt install apache2   Install PHP  apt install libapache2-mod-php7.3 php7.3 php7.3-common php7.3-curl php7.3-gd php7.3-imagick php7.3-mbstring php7.3-mysql php7.3-json php7.3-xsl php7.3-intl php7.3-zip    Creating a database for your shop If you are installing PrestaShop on a web server, then you must create the database and give access to a privileged user. You will need this user\u0026rsquo;s credentials to configure PrestaShop during the installation process.\nUsing phpMyAdmin We assume you have root access to phpMyAdmin, and you\u0026rsquo;re using version 4.x.\n Sign in to phpMyAdmin as the root user Click User accounts, and then click on Add user account Fill the User name and the Password In the Database for user account, select Create database and Grant all privileges Create user and database and make sure the COLLATION of your database is utf8mb4_general_ci  From the command line The database must be created with 4-Byte UTF-8 encoding (utf8mb4_general_ci). For information on installation and configuring MySQL see the MySQL 5.6 documentation. Connect as root to your MySql server. In this example our root user is called adminusername:\n$ mysql -u adminusername -p Create the database and give it a name like \u0026ldquo;prestashop\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026gt; CREATE DATABASE prestashop COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci; Grant privileges to that database to a new user (the one that PrestaShop will use to connect to the database).

Their details can be found on a public Google Cloud storage.\nChoosing the right version for you PrestaShop comes in two \u0026ldquo;flavors\u0026rdquo;:\n Release package. A zip package, tuned for production environments. Development version. The raw source code as it is on the GitHub repository, including automated test suites, build scripts and source codes for assets that are otherwise compiled (like javascript and css files).  Prefer cloning the repository using git for the development version.\nIf you intend to work on PrestaShop itself, we suggest using Git to clone the source code of PrestaShop from the GitHub repository.\n Repository branches As stated above, if you decide to work on PrestaShop itself, it\u0026rsquo;s best to clone the PrestaShop repository and work using git. Depending on the version of PrestaShop you want to work on, you will need to choose the right branch:\n The develop branch contains the current work in progress for the next minor or major version.  This is the right branch to contribute new features, refactors, small bug fixes, etc.   The maintenance branches (1.6.1.x, 1.7.0.x, 1.7.1.x, 1.7.2.x, \u0026hellip;) contains all patches made for each minor version.  For example, the 1.7.2.x branch contains all patches from 1.7.2.0 to 1.7.2.5. Whenever a new minor or major version is ready for release, a new maintenance branch is created. For example, 1.7.0.x for version 1.7.0.0, 1.7.1.x for 1.7.1.0, 1.7.2.x for 1.7.2.0, and so forth. Only the most recent maintenance branch accepts new contributions     Clone the repository using Git or extract the zip package in a prestashop folder inside the document folder of the AMP installer you chose:\n XAMPP: C:\\xampp\\htdocs or /Applications/xampp/htdocs WampServer: C:\\wamp\\www EasyPHP: C:\\easyphp\\www MAMP: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/  Download dependencies This step is only needed if you downloaded the development version. PHP dependencies Use composer to download the project\u0026rsquo;s dependencies:\ncd /path/to/prestashop composer install # or alternatively, since 1.7.8: make composer JavaScript and CSS dependencies PrestaShop uses NPM to manage dependencies and Webpack to compile them into static assets. You only need NodeJS 8.x (12.x maximum get it here), NPM will take care of it all.\ncd /path/to/prestashop make assets Alternatively, you can compile assets manually.\nSetting up file rights PrestaShop needs recursive write permissions on several directories:\n ./admin-dev/autoupgrade ./app/config ./app/logs ./app/Resources/translations ./cache ./config ./download ./img ./log ./mails ./modules ./themes ./translations ./upload ./var  You can set up the appropriate permissions using this command:\n$ chmod +w -R admin-dev/autoupgrade app/config app/logs app/Resources/translations cache config download img log mails modules themes translations upload var If you do not have some of the folders above, please create them before changing permissions. For example:\n$ mkdir log app/logs To ease up your life on a development environment, we suggest to make Apache run with your own user and group.\nNever do that in production! Carefully change permissions folder by folder instead. Installing PrestaShop Open the PrestaShop installer and follow its instructions.\nDepending on whether you downloaded a release package or cloned the repository, the route to the installer will be slightly different:\n Release package: http://127.0.0.1/prestashop/install Development version: http://127.0.0.1/prestashop/install-dev  You can read the Getting Started guide for more details.\nTroubleshooting Compile Error: Cannot declare class AppKernel, because the name is already in use You may find this error message the first time you open up the Back Office.\nThis problem may arise in case-insensitive file systems like MacOS due to a misconfiguration. Check your Apache configuration and make sure that the root directory path to your PrestaShop matches the capitalization of the actual system path exactly. A typical error is for example having a folder named /path/to/PrestaShop (capital P, capital S) and then configuring it in Apache as /path/to/Prestashop (missing the capital S).\n"

	"content": "Behat testing It is important that you get familiar with the Behats principles before reading further. You can find the official behat documentation here. A behaviour (behat) tests are a part of integration tests. They allow testing how multiple components are working together. In PrestaShop, behats are used to test the Application and Domain layer integration - basically all the CQRS commands and queries.\nDatabase During behat tests the actual database queries are executed, therefore before testing you need to run a command composer create-test-db to create a test database.\nThe create-test-db script installs a fresh prestashop with fixtures in a new database called test_{your database name} and dumps the database in your machine /tmp directory named ps_dump.sql. That ps_dump.sql is later used to reset the database. You can check the actual script for more information - /tests-legacy/create-test-db.php. Behats structure in PrestaShop Behat related files are located in tests/Integration/Behaviour/. This directory contains following files:\n behat.yml - this is the test suites configuration file which describes feature paths and contexts for every test suite. It can be passed as an argument when running the tests like this ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml. bootstrap.php - this file loads the Kernel for a behat tests environment. Features - this directory contains all the Scenarios and Contexts. More about it below.  Features Before continuing, please read the official behat documentation about the features and scenarios. In PrestaShop all *.feature files are placed in .tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario. Each feature is placed in a dedicated directory organized by domain (or even a subdomain if necessary). These feature files contains text that describes the testing scenarios in a user-friendly manner, each of them must start with a keyword Feature and have a one or multiple scenarios starting with a keyword Scenario. For example:\nFeature: Update product status from BO (Back Office) As an employee I must be able to update product status (enable/disable) Scenario: I update standard product status Given I add product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; with following information: | name[en-US] | Values list poster nr. 1 (paper) | | type | standard | And product product1 type should be standard And product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; should be disabled When I enable product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; Then product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; should be enabled When I disable product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; Then product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; should be disabled As you can see, we state the given information, then we describe the action and finally the assertion. These scenarios should be easy to understand even for non-technical people. So when writing one, try to avoid the technical keywords and make it as user-friendly as possible.\nThere is also a keyword Background, which allows running certain code before each scenario. See more here. Every line in scenario has a related method defined in a Context.\nContext The behat Context files are classes that contains the implementations of the features. In PrestaShop all Context files are placed in tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario.\nThe most recent Context files are located in Tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Context/Domain namespace, so try to use these and avoid the ones from the Tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Context/* namespace (those are old and might not be implemented well). When creating a new Context class, it should extend the AbstractDomainFeatureContext.\nThe AbstractDomainFeatureContext contains some commonly used helper methods, and it implements the Behat\\Behat\\Context which is necessary for these tests to work. This is how the context looks like:\nclass OrderFeatureContext extends AbstractDomainFeatureContext { // ...  /** * @Given I add order :orderReference with the following details: * * @param string $orderReference * @param TableNode $table */ public function addOrderWithTheFollowingDetails(string $orderReference, TableNode $table) { $testCaseData = $table-\u0026gt;getRowsHash(); $data = $this-\u0026gt;mapAddOrderFromBackOfficeData($testCaseData); /** @var OrderId $orderId */ $orderId = $this-\u0026gt;getCommandBus()-\u0026gt;handle( new AddOrderFromBackOfficeCommand( $data[\u0026#39;cartId\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;employeeId\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;orderMessage\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;paymentModuleName\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;orderStateId\u0026#39;] ) ); SharedStorage::getStorage()-\u0026gt;set($orderReference, $orderId-\u0026gt;getValue()); } // ...  As you can see in example, the string @Given I add order :orderReference with the following details: maps this method to related line in *.feature file. The :orderReference acts as a variable which actually is the id of the order, that is saved into the SharedStorage. The TableNode $table is a specific argument, you can read about it here.\nShared storage The SharedStorage is responsible for holding certain values in memory which are shared across the feature. The most common usage example is the id reference - we specify a certain keyword e.g. product1 before creating it, and once the command returns the auto-incremented value, we set it in shared storage like this SharedStorage::getStorage()-\u0026gt;set($orderReference, $orderId-\u0026gt;getValue());. In upcoming scenarios we can reuse this reference to get the record, something like this:\nprotected function getProductForEditing(string $reference): ProductForEditing { $productId = $this-\u0026gt;getSharedStorage()-\u0026gt;get($reference); return $this-\u0026gt;getQueryBus()-\u0026gt;handle(new GetProductForEditing( $productId )); } Hooks Behats allow you to use hooks. You can find some usages in CommonFeatureContext. You can use these hooked methods by tagging them before the Feature (or before Scenario depending on the hook type), like this (add_product.feature ):\n@clear-cache-before-feature @clear-cache-after-feature Feature: Add basic product from Back Office (BO) As a BO user I need to be able to add new product with basic information from the BO  You can also tag specific features if you want to run only them with a --tags filter. For example, if you add following tag in your Feature:\n@add Feature: Add basic product from Back Office (BO) As a BO user I need to be able to add new product with basic information from the BO ... Then you can run only this feature by following command ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml -s product --tags add\n behat.yml When you have already created features and contexts it is time to map them with the test suite. The mapping is done in the behat.yml configuration file. It looks like this:\ndefault:suites:customer:paths:- %paths.base%/Features/Scenario/Customercontexts:- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CommonFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CustomerManagerFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\Domain\\CustomerFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CustomerFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\Configuration\\CommonConfigurationFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Transform\\StringToBoolTransformContextcategory:paths:- %paths.base%/Features/Scenario/Categorycontexts:- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CommonFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CategoryFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\Domain\\CategoryFeatureContextAs you can see, you have to define the suite, the path to features, and all the necessary contexts. According to the example, when you run the following: ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml -s customer - all the *.feature files from tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario/Customer directory will be used to execute the related methods in all the provided contexts.\n"

That ps_dump.sql is later used to reset the database. You can check the actual script for more information - /tests-legacy/create-test-db.php. Behats structure in PrestaShop Behat related files are located in tests/Integration/Behaviour/. This directory contains following files:\n behat.yml - this is the test suites configuration file which describes feature paths and contexts for every test suite. It can be passed as an argument when running the tests like this ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml. bootstrap.php - this file loads the Kernel for a behat tests environment. Features - this directory contains all the Scenarios and Contexts. More about it below.  Features Before continuing, please read the official behat documentation about the features and scenarios. In PrestaShop all *.feature files are placed in .tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario. Each feature is placed in a dedicated directory organized by domain (or even a subdomain if necessary). These feature files contains text that describes the testing scenarios in a user-friendly manner, each of them must start with a keyword Feature and have a one or multiple scenarios starting with a keyword Scenario. For example:\nFeature: Update product status from BO (Back Office) As an employee I must be able to update product status (enable/disable) Scenario: I update standard product status Given I add product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; with following information: | name[en-US] | Values list poster nr. 1 (paper) | | type | standard | And product product1 type should be standard And product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; should be disabled When I enable product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; Then product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; should be enabled When I disable product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; Then product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; should be disabled As you can see, we state the given information, then we describe the action and finally the assertion. These scenarios should be easy to understand even for non-technical people. So when writing one, try to avoid the technical keywords and make it as user-friendly as possible.\nThere is also a keyword Background, which allows running certain code before each scenario. See more here. Every line in scenario has a related method defined in a Context.\nContext The behat Context files are classes that contains the implementations of the features. In PrestaShop all Context files are placed in tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario.\nThe most recent Context files are located in Tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Context/Domain namespace, so try to use these and avoid the ones from the Tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Context/* namespace (those are old and might not be implemented well). When creating a new Context class, it should extend the AbstractDomainFeatureContext.\nThe AbstractDomainFeatureContext contains some commonly used helper methods, and it implements the Behat\\Behat\\Context which is necessary for these tests to work. This is how the context looks like:\nclass OrderFeatureContext extends AbstractDomainFeatureContext { // ...  /** * @Given I add order :orderReference with the following details: * * @param string $orderReference * @param TableNode $table */ public function addOrderWithTheFollowingDetails(string $orderReference, TableNode $table) { $testCaseData = $table-\u0026gt;getRowsHash(); $data = $this-\u0026gt;mapAddOrderFromBackOfficeData($testCaseData); /** @var OrderId $orderId */ $orderId = $this-\u0026gt;getCommandBus()-\u0026gt;handle( new AddOrderFromBackOfficeCommand( $data[\u0026#39;cartId\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;employeeId\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;orderMessage\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;paymentModuleName\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;orderStateId\u0026#39;] ) ); SharedStorage::getStorage()-\u0026gt;set($orderReference, $orderId-\u0026gt;getValue()); } // ...  As you can see in example, the string @Given I add order :orderReference with the following details: maps this method to related line in *.feature file. The :orderReference acts as a variable which actually is the id of the order, that is saved into the SharedStorage. The TableNode $table is a specific argument, you can read about it here.\nShared storage The SharedStorage is responsible for holding certain values in memory which are shared across the feature. The most common usage example is the id reference - we specify a certain keyword e.g. product1 before creating it, and once the command returns the auto-incremented value, we set it in shared storage like this SharedStorage::getStorage()-\u0026gt;set($orderReference, $orderId-\u0026gt;getValue());. In upcoming scenarios we can reuse this reference to get the record, something like this:\nprotected function getProductForEditing(string $reference): ProductForEditing { $productId = $this-\u0026gt;getSharedStorage()-\u0026gt;get($reference); return $this-\u0026gt;getQueryBus()-\u0026gt;handle(new GetProductForEditing( $productId )); } Hooks Behats allow you to use hooks. You can find some usages in CommonFeatureContext. You can use these hooked methods by tagging them before the Feature (or before Scenario depending on the hook type), like this (add_product.feature ):\n@clear-cache-before-feature @clear-cache-after-feature Feature: Add basic product from Back Office (BO) As a BO user I need to be able to add new product with basic information from the BO  You can also tag specific features if you want to run only them with a --tags filter. For example, if you add following tag in your Feature:\n@add Feature: Add basic product from Back Office (BO) As a BO user I need to be able to add new product with basic information from the BO ... Then you can run only this feature by following command ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml -s product --tags add\n behat.yml When you have already created features and contexts it is time to map them with the test suite. The mapping is done in the behat.yml configuration file. It looks like this:\ndefault:suites:customer:paths:- %paths.base%/Features/Scenario/Customercontexts:- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CommonFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CustomerManagerFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\Domain\\CustomerFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CustomerFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\Configuration\\CommonConfigurationFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Transform\\StringToBoolTransformContextcategory:paths:- %paths.base%/Features/Scenario/Categorycontexts:- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CommonFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CategoryFeatureContext- Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\Domain\\CategoryFeatureContextAs you can see, you have to define the suite, the path to features, and all the necessary contexts. According to the example, when you run the following: ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml -s customer - all the *.feature files from tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario/Customer directory will be used to execute the related methods in all the provided contexts.\n"

Communicate Starting this step means that the Development phase of this release is over. Before you go further, make sure to tick the \u0026ldquo;Development\u0026rdquo; box in the Release Tracker GitHub issue (there is one per version, see the 1.7.6.6 example).\n2. Create a local branch for your build The following tasks will require you to perform changes and submit them as a Pull Request.\n  Clone the project on your computer using Git (only if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have a local copy of the repository).\ngit clone git@github.com:PrestaShop/PrestaShop.git   Make sure that you switch to the appropriate branch regarding the version you\u0026rsquo;ll be building (e.g. you must be on branch 1.7.7.x if you\u0026rsquo;re building a 1.7.7 release).\n  Make sure your branch is up-to-date with upstream. Especially if you already had a local clone of the repository.\n  Create a local branch for your work. Keep it! You will need to go back to it later.\n  3. Merge any not-yet published security fixes About security advisories.\nTo avoid disclosing security issues, security Pull Request are merged after the build has been done and validated. In order to include them in your build, you need to retrieve them manually and merge them in your local branch.\n If this release includes security PRs:\n Add the different private temporary repositories for each Security Advisory as remotes of your local git repository. Merge each one of those PRs into your working local branch.  4. Update the Changelog \u0026amp; Contributors list Use the changelog tool to extract the data This step requires special rights.\nAsk a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with access to the Changelog Tool to perform this step.\n After this step, you should obtain two files:\n the Changelog file – including a list of all the merged Pull Requests. Make sure to keep this file, you\u0026rsquo;ll need it later. the New Contributors file – a list of all the people who contributed code for this version for their first time.  Update the files in the project  Add the contents of the changelog at the top end of PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Changelog file. Update PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s Contributors file by adding the new contributors. Keep the alphabetical order. Commit your changed files with following message: // Changelog [version] You may push this branch to your own (private) fork, if you wish to.  If you\u0026rsquo;re lost, see this example from the 1.7.6.6 release. 5. Build the ZIP archive Use the Release Creator CLI script included with PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s sources to create the ZIP archive.\nFrom the root path of your repository, execute:\nphp tools/build/CreateRelease.php --version=\u0026#34;1.7.6.6\u0026#34;  Note: the version number will be the same for pre-release versions and final release versions. This tool creates a build based on the state of your workspace using git archive. Therefore, files not tracked by git won\u0026rsquo;t be included in the build.\nMake sure you\u0026rsquo;re building from the branch you updated in the previous step. Otherwise the package won\u0026rsquo;t include the updated changelog and contributors files.\nBy default, the release package will create two files in a new subdirectory in /tools/build/releases:\n A ZIP package, containing the software. An XML file, containing md5 checksums for every file within the package.  Make sure to keep them both! You will need them later on. As an optional step, consider downloading the latest stable release package and compare the contents of the zip archives to look for suspicious changes.\n6. Upload your build for archiving Rename files Rename both files according to our naming convention:\nprestashop_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;-[beta.\u0026lt;beta number\u0026gt;|rc.\u0026lt;rc number\u0026gt;]+build.\u0026lt;build number\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;zip|xml\u0026gt;  Examples  prestashop_1.7.4.0-beta.1+build.1.zip – First build of beta 1 prestashop_1.7.4.0-beta.1+build.2.zip – Second build of beta 1 prestashop_1.7.4.0-beta.2+build.1.zip – First build of beta 2 prestashop_1.7.4.0-rc.1+build.1.zip – First build of RC 1 prestashop_1.7.4.0+build.1.zip – First build of final version prestashop_1.7.4.0+build.2.zip – Second build of final version  For major versions, we may build a Beta Version (example: prestashop_1.7.4.0-beta.1+build.1.zip).\nWhen the beta testing phase is over, we build one Release Candidate (example: prestashop_1.7.4.0-rc.1+build.1.zip).\nFor patch versions, the beta and RC phase can be skipped (example: prestashop_1.7.4.1+build.1.zip)\n Upload files to the archive This step requires special rights.\nSend both ZIP and XML files to a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with access to the Archive Drive to perform this step.\n 7. Communicate and wait for QA validation At this point, the build process is over.\n Make sure the build files have been submitted to the QA team. Update the Release Tracker GitHub issue. Tick the \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo; box, and add a comment to announce that the build has been submitted to QA (see example). Wait for QA to validate the build.  If the QA rejects the build In case the QA team finds blocking defects in the build, then these issues must be fixed and merged before the branch can be built again.\n Communicate that the build validation has failed by updating the Release Tracker GitHub issue. Fix the issues or wait for them to be fixed and merged in the version branch. Repeat the build process from the top. Make sure that you have checked out the head of the updated version branch.  Once the QA has greenlighted the build, you can move on to publishing the version. "

	"description": "",
	"content": "CRUD Forms Introduction In computer programming, CRUD is an acronym for the four basic functions of persistent storage: create, read, update, and delete.\nPrestaShop handles several logic objects, like Cart, Product, Order, Customer\u0026hellip; among many others. When such objects are stored using a unique identifier, we refer to them as identifiable objects.\nIn the Back Office, most identifiable objects are managed using forms and page listings that follow the CRUD pattern. When they do, we refer to those forms as CRUD Forms.\nSince CRUD forms share a lot of common behavior, PrestaShop provides a common pattern to handle them all the same way. It is based on four main elements, each responsible for a very specific task:\n A Form Builder, that initializes the form (using a provided Form Type). A Form Handler, that handles the form when it\u0026rsquo;s submitted. A Form Data Provider that provides data to prefill the form as it\u0026rsquo;s displayed. And a Form Data Handler that saves the submitted form data to the database.  PrestaShop already provides default implementations for the first two, so in most cases you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to reuse them instead of creating your own. Form Data Provider The Form Data Provider takes care of retrieving data to fill out a form. For that, it needs to implement two methods:\n getData(mixed $id): array Retrieves data for an edit form, using the given id to retrieve the object\u0026rsquo;s data. getDefaultData(): array Returns default data for a creation form.   Creating a Form Data Provider To create a Form data provider you must implement the following interface:\n\\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider\\FormDataProviderInterface  In the example below, you can see a ContactFormDataProvider that queries the database (in this case, using ObjectModel) to retrieve data when a specific identifiable object id (in this case, Contact) is given, and that returns static data with defaults to use when creating a new element.\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider; use Contact; final class ContactFormDataProvider implements FormDataProviderInterface { /** * Get form data for given object with given id. * * @param int $id * * @return mixed */ public function getData($contactId) { $contactObjectModel = new Contact($contactId); // check that the element exists in db  if (empty($contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;id)) { throw new PrestaShopObjectNotFoundException(\u0026#39;Object not found\u0026#39;); } return [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;name, ]; } /** * Get default form data. * * @return mixed */ public function getDefaultData() { return [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;service\u0026#39;, ]; } }  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nThe core actually uses the CQRS pattern to retrieve data, instead of ObjectModel. For more information, have a look at our recommended approach on how to use CQRS in forms.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to register your class as a service, you will need it to use it with the Form builder.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_data_provider.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_provider.contact_form_data_provider:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider\\ContactFormDataProvider\u0026#39;Form Builder The Form Builder is used by controllers to build the form that will be shown to users.\nPrestaShop provides a default implementation for this object.\nIt should be enough for most use cases, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create it yourself! It also allows your form to be extended by modules.\n The common methods that you will be using are:\n getForm(array $data = [], array $options = []): FormInterface Generates and returns the Symfony form. Additional $data and $options can be used in your form type. getFormFor(mixed $id, array $data = [], array $options = []): FormInterface Generates and returns the Symfony form for an editable object which already exists and can be identified. Additional $data and $options can be used in your form type.   Using the Form Builder In most cases, you can simply reuse the default implementation. All you need to do is declare it as a service and configure it for your form\u0026rsquo;s needs, by specifying the appropriate Form type and Form data provider.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_builder.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Builder\\FormBuilder\u0026#39;factory:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.builder.form_builder_factory:create\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Form\\Admin\\Configure\\ShopParameters\\Contact\\ContactType\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_provider.contact_form_data_provider\u0026#39;In the example above, we are declaring a specific service for this form based on PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s implementation of the Form Builder:\nPrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Builder\\FormBuilder  \u0026hellip;which is instantiated using the base factory:\nprestashop.core.form.builder.form_builder_factory:create \u0026hellip;using two specific arguments:\n The Form Type\u0026rsquo;s class name The Form Data Provider\u0026rsquo;s service name, that we declared previously.  Finally, use it in your controller:\n\u0026lt;?php public function createAction($contactId) { $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;); $contactForm = $contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getForm(); // no id as the element does not exist yet  return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/create.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); } public function editAction($contactId) { $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;); $contactForm = $contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getFormFor($contactId); return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/edit.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); } Form that is rendered following PretaShop\u0026rsquo;s UI kit should look like this:\n Result of form builder   Form Data Handler The Form Data Handler is responsible for persisting the data submitted through your form. It implements the following methods:\n create(array $data): mixed Creates a new identifiable object using the provided data and returns the created object\u0026rsquo;s id. update(mixed $id, array $data): void Updates the object identified by $id using the provided data   Creating a Form Data Handler When creating your Form Data Handler you must implement the following interface:\n\\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler\\FormDataHandlerInterface  In the example below, you can see a ConctactFormDataHandler that uses ObjectModel to create and update an instance of Contact:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler; final class ContactFormDataHandler implements FormDataHandlerInterface { /** * Create object from form data. * * @param array $data * * @return mixed */ public function create(array $data) { $contactObjectModel = new Contact(); // add data to object model  // ...  $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;save(); return $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;id; } /** * Update object with form data. * * @param int $id * @param array $data */ public function update($id, array $data) { $contactObjectModel = new Contact(id); // update data to object model  // ...  $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;update(); } }  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nThe core actually uses the CQRS pattern to retrieve data, instead of ObjectModel. For more information, have a look at our recommended approach on how to use CQRS in forms.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to register your Form Data Handler as a service, you will need it to use it with your Form Handler.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_data_handler.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_handler.contact_form_data_handler:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler\\ContactFormDataHandler\u0026#39;Form Handler The Form Handler is in charge of validating, enriching and saving submitted form data, using the provided Form Data Handler.\nPrestaShop provides a default implementation for this object.\nIt should be enough for most use cases, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create it yourself! It also allows your form to be extended by modules.\n It provides two methods:\n handle(FormInterface $form): FormHandlerResultInterface Saves form data by creating new instance of the related identifiable object. handleFor($id, FormInterface $form): FormHandlerResultInterface Saves form data by updating the related object identified by $id.   Both methods return an instance of FormHandlerResultInterface that provides information about the process result:\n isValid(): bool Indicates whether the form contains errors or not isSubmitted(): bool Indicates if the form was submitted getIdentifiableObjectId(): mixed Returns the Id of the identifiable object created by the form submit, if applicable   Using the Form Handler Much like with the Form Builder, in most cases you can reuse the default implementation by declaring it as a service and configuring it according to your form\u0026rsquo;s needs:\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_handler.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.contact_form_handler:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Handler\\FormHandler\u0026#39;factory:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.form_handler_factory:create\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_handler.contact_form_data_handler\u0026#39;In the example above, we are declaring a specific service for this form handler, based on PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s implementation of the Form Handler:\nPrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Handler\\FormHandler \u0026hellip;wich is instantiated using the base factory:\nprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.form_handler_factory:create \u0026hellip;using the Form Data Handler that we declared previouly.\nFinally, you can use it in your controller like this:\n\u0026lt;?php public function createAction(Request $request) { $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;);

=\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); } Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze the create flow in the example above.\nFirst, we create the form using the FormBuilder:\n\u0026lt;?php $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;); $contactForm = $contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getForm(); Then, we merge the form\u0026rsquo;s data with the one from the Request (if submitted):\n\u0026lt;?php $contactForm-\u0026gt;handleRequest($request); Afterwards, we process the form (this will save the form in case it was sent, and do nothing otherwise), and save the result of the process for further analysis:\n\u0026lt;?php $contactFormHandler = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.contact_form_handler\u0026#39;); $result = $contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handle($contactForm); Now, if the form was actually saved and everything went well, we can show a success message and redirect to the listing page:\n\u0026lt;?php if (null !== $result-\u0026gt;getIdentifiableObjectId()) { $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;success\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Successful creation.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Notifications.Success\u0026#39;)); return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_contacts_index\u0026#39;); } Finally, if the form wasn\u0026rsquo;t submit or if something went wrong, we just show the form.\n\u0026lt;?php return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/create.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); The edit flow works exactly the same, with minimal changes:\n-$contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getForm(); +$contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getFormFor($contactId); and\n-$contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handle($contactForm); +$contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handleFor($contactId, $contactForm);  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nThe core actually uses CQRS to handle data persistence, which raises a DomainException in case of a constraint error (for example, if the identifiable object you are trying to edit doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist). This is handled in the controller by wrapping the code in a try-catch block, then flashing an error message accordingly.\nFor more details, check out the ContactsController source code on GitHub.\n Summary as a schema The following schema depicts the complete form flow, including the Domain tier which uses the CQRS pattern. Learn more about it here.\n Identifiable object forms schema   "

	"content": "CRUD Forms Introduction In computer programming, CRUD is an acronym for the four basic functions of persistent storage: create, read, update, and delete.\nPrestaShop handles several logic objects, like Cart, Product, Order, Customer\u0026hellip; among many others. When such objects are stored using a unique identifier, we refer to them as identifiable objects.\nIn the Back Office, most identifiable objects are managed using forms and page listings that follow the CRUD pattern. When they do, we refer to those forms as CRUD Forms.\nSince CRUD forms share a lot of common behavior, PrestaShop provides a common pattern to handle them all the same way. It is based on four main elements, each responsible for a very specific task:\n A Form Builder, that initializes the form (using a provided Form Type). A Form Handler, that handles the form when it\u0026rsquo;s submitted. A Form Data Provider that provides data to prefill the form as it\u0026rsquo;s displayed. And a Form Data Handler that saves the submitted form data to the database.  PrestaShop already provides default implementations for the first two, so in most cases you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to reuse them instead of creating your own. Form Data Provider The Form Data Provider takes care of retrieving data to fill out a form. For that, it needs to implement two methods:\n getData(mixed $id): array Retrieves data for an edit form, using the given id to retrieve the object\u0026rsquo;s data. getDefaultData(): array Returns default data for a creation form.   Creating a Form Data Provider To create a Form data provider you must implement the following interface:\n\\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider\\FormDataProviderInterface  In the example below, you can see a ContactFormDataProvider that queries the database (in this case, using ObjectModel) to retrieve data when a specific identifiable object id (in this case, Contact) is given, and that returns static data with defaults to use when creating a new element.\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider; use Contact; final class ContactFormDataProvider implements FormDataProviderInterface { /** * Get form data for given object with given id. * * @param int $id * * @return mixed */ public function getData($contactId) { $contactObjectModel = new Contact($contactId); // check that the element exists in db  if (empty($contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;id)) { throw new PrestaShopObjectNotFoundException(\u0026#39;Object not found\u0026#39;); } return [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;name, ]; } /** * Get default form data. * * @return mixed */ public function getDefaultData() { return [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;service\u0026#39;, ]; } }  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nThe core actually uses the CQRS pattern to retrieve data, instead of ObjectModel. For more information, have a look at our recommended approach on how to use CQRS in forms.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to register your class as a service, you will need it to use it with the Form builder.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_data_provider.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_provider.contact_form_data_provider:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider\\ContactFormDataProvider\u0026#39;Form Builder The Form Builder is used by controllers to build the form that will be shown to users.\nPrestaShop provides a default implementation for this object.\nIt should be enough for most use cases, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to create it yourself! It also allows your form to be extended by modules.\n The common methods that you will be using are:\n getForm(array $data = [], array $options = []): FormInterface Generates and returns the Symfony form. Additional $data and $options can be used in your form type. getFormFor(mixed $id, array $data = [], array $options = []): FormInterface Generates and returns the Symfony form for an editable object which already exists and can be identified. Additional $data and $options can be used in your form type.   Using the Form Builder In most cases, you can simply reuse the default implementation. All you need to do is declare it as a service and configure it for your form\u0026rsquo;s needs, by specifying the appropriate Form type and Form data provider.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_builder.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Builder\\FormBuilder\u0026#39;factory:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.builder.form_builder_factory:create\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Form\\Admin\\Configure\\ShopParameters\\Contact\\ContactType\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_provider.contact_form_data_provider\u0026#39;In the example above, we are declaring a specific service for this form based on PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s implementation of the Form Builder:\nPrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Builder\\FormBuilder  \u0026hellip;which is instantiated using the base factory:\nprestashop.core.form.builder.form_builder_factory:create \u0026hellip;using two specific arguments:\n The Form Type\u0026rsquo;s class name The Form Data Provider\u0026rsquo;s service name, that we declared previously.  Finally, use it in your controller:\n\u0026lt;?php public function createAction($contactId) { $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;); $contactForm = $contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getForm(); // no id as the element does not exist yet  return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/create.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); } public function editAction($contactId) { $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;); $contactForm = $contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getFormFor($contactId); return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/edit.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); } Form that is rendered following PretaShop\u0026rsquo;s UI kit should look like this:\n Result of form builder   Form Data Handler The Form Data Handler is responsible for persisting the data submitted through your form. It implements the following methods:\n create(array $data): mixed Creates a new identifiable object using the provided data and returns the created object\u0026rsquo;s id. update(mixed $id, array $data): void Updates the object identified by $id using the provided data   Creating a Form Data Handler When creating your Form Data Handler you must implement the following interface:\n\\PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler\\FormDataHandlerInterface  In the example below, you can see a ConctactFormDataHandler that uses ObjectModel to create and update an instance of Contact:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler; final class ContactFormDataHandler implements FormDataHandlerInterface { /** * Create object from form data. * * @param array $data * * @return mixed */ public function create(array $data) { $contactObjectModel = new Contact(); // add data to object model  // ...  $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;save(); return $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;id; } /** * Update object with form data. * * @param int $id * @param array $data */ public function update($id, array $data) { $contactObjectModel = new Contact(id); // update data to object model  // ...  $contactObjectModel-\u0026gt;update(); } }  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nThe core actually uses the CQRS pattern to retrieve data, instead of ObjectModel.

It also allows your form to be extended by modules.\n It provides two methods:\n handle(FormInterface $form): FormHandlerResultInterface Saves form data by creating new instance of the related identifiable object. handleFor($id, FormInterface $form): FormHandlerResultInterface Saves form data by updating the related object identified by $id.   Both methods return an instance of FormHandlerResultInterface that provides information about the process result:\n isValid(): bool Indicates whether the form contains errors or not isSubmitted(): bool Indicates if the form was submitted getIdentifiableObjectId(): mixed Returns the Id of the identifiable object created by the form submit, if applicable   Using the Form Handler Much like with the Form Builder, in most cases you can reuse the default implementation by declaring it as a service and configuring it according to your form\u0026rsquo;s needs:\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_handler.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.contact_form_handler:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Handler\\FormHandler\u0026#39;factory:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.form_handler_factory:create\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_handler.contact_form_data_handler\u0026#39;In the example above, we are declaring a specific service for this form handler, based on PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s implementation of the Form Handler:\nPrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\Handler\\FormHandler \u0026hellip;wich is instantiated using the base factory:\nprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.form_handler_factory:create \u0026hellip;using the Form Data Handler that we declared previouly.\nFinally, you can use it in your controller like this:\n\u0026lt;?php public function createAction(Request $request) { $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;);

// we use handleFor() instead of handle() since we now have an id  $result = $contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handleFor($contactId, $contactForm); if ($result-\u0026gt;isSubmitted() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $result-\u0026gt;isValid()) { $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;success\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Successful update.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Notifications.Success\u0026#39;)); return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_contacts_index\u0026#39;); } return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/edit.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); } Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze the create flow in the example above.\nFirst, we create the form using the FormBuilder:\n\u0026lt;?php $contactFormBuilder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.builder.contact_form_builder\u0026#39;); $contactForm = $contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getForm(); Then, we merge the form\u0026rsquo;s data with the one from the Request (if submitted):\n\u0026lt;?php $contactForm-\u0026gt;handleRequest($request); Afterwards, we process the form (this will save the form in case it was sent, and do nothing otherwise), and save the result of the process for further analysis:\n\u0026lt;?php $contactFormHandler = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.handler.contact_form_handler\u0026#39;); $result = $contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handle($contactForm); Now, if the form was actually saved and everything went well, we can show a success message and redirect to the listing page:\n\u0026lt;?php if (null !== $result-\u0026gt;getIdentifiableObjectId()) { $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;success\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Successful creation.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Notifications.Success\u0026#39;)); return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_contacts_index\u0026#39;); } Finally, if the form wasn\u0026rsquo;t submit or if something went wrong, we just show the form.\n\u0026lt;?php return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Configure/ShopParameters/Contact/Contacts/create.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;contactForm\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $contactForm-\u0026gt;createView(), ]); The edit flow works exactly the same, with minimal changes:\n-$contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getForm(); +$contactFormBuilder-\u0026gt;getFormFor($contactId); and\n-$contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handle($contactForm); +$contactFormHandler-\u0026gt;handleFor($contactId, $contactForm);  This example has been simplified for practical reasons.\nThe core actually uses CQRS to handle data persistence, which raises a DomainException in case of a constraint error (for example, if the identifiable object you are trying to edit doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist). This is handled in the controller by wrapping the code in a try-catch block, then flashing an error message accordingly.\nFor more details, check out the ContactsController source code on GitHub.\n Summary as a schema The following schema depicts the complete form flow, including the Domain tier which uses the CQRS pattern.

	"content": "The Pull Request form When you create a new Pull Request, you will be presented with a form that looks like this:\nThe first step is to write a summary of your pull request\u0026rsquo;s purpose in its GitHub title.\nWriting a good title A Pull Request title should be short, but precise enough to describe the changes it introduces and how they impact the software.\nPlease respect the following rules:\n Be descriptive. Avoid laconic or non-descriptive sentences, like \u0026ldquo;Fix bug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Update file.php\u0026rdquo;. Write full sentences. Avoid writing sentences without verbs, like \u0026ldquo;Yaml standards\u0026rdquo;. Use the imperative mood (eg. \u0026ldquo;Add foo bar\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Added\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;Adding\u0026rdquo;). This will help keep changelog style coherent. Don\u0026rsquo;t include references. Don\u0026rsquo;t add issue references like \u0026quot;#12314 Fix issue on\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; or tags like \u0026quot;[BO] Fix bug where\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;. The PR table is there for that.  Here are some good examples:\n Fix fatal error when trying to sign up on Chrome Prevent users from deleting their own profile on the users listing Reduce memory usage on the Front Office home Add button to close the welcome message on first login Migrate product page to Symfony  Why this is important?\nPull Requests titles are used to build the Changelog we publish on each release. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example.\n The Pull Request form Once you have chosen a title for your Pull Request, you are asked to fill out the Pull Request table. Filling it out properly is mandatory.\nAlong other reasons, it helps maintainers:\n Make sure that the change works as expected Track when a change fixes a known issue Track if a change introduced affects backwards compatibility (BC breaks) Build the change log (changes are grouped by type and category).  Let\u0026rsquo;s see what each of the rows is for.\nBranch This part is needed to cross-check that your PR targets the branch that you intended. Just write the name of the target branch, as explained in Supported branches.\nDescription Describing your change and the reasoning behind it is extremely important for it to be reviewed and approved. Explain, in as much detail as you can, what did you change and why.\nIf you need space, just write a short summary about your change in the table, then describe in more detail below it. You are also encouraged to add links, files, screenshots\u0026hellip; anything that can help reviewers understand why the change is needed, and why it\u0026rsquo;s valid.\nTip: If you find yourself short on inspiration, use this Pull Request as an example. Type \u0026amp; Category Type is used to describe what kind of a change your Pull Request is. Refer to the following table to choose the most appropriate:\n   Type Scope     bug fix The changes fix a bug.   improvement The changes improve an already existing feature (eg. cosmetic or UX changes, performance improvement, etc).   new feature The changes introduce a behavior that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before (eg. add a button, a new page, a new block\u0026hellip;)   refacto The changes only refactor code, without changing any of its side effects.    The category is the main part of the project affected by your changes. Choose the code that most closely describes your change:\n   Code Scope     FO The changes impact the Front Office   BO The changes impact the Back Office   IN The changes impact the Installer   WS The changes impact the Web Services   CO The changes impact the Core (non-visible functionality)   LO The changes impact localization functionality   TE The changes impact automated tests   ME The changes only import a git branch into another (eg. merge maintenance branch into develop)   PM The changes are related to project management (eg. edit Github pull request form)    Remember, this is only needed for the Pull Request form, not for your commit messages. Why is this important?\nWe use type \u0026amp; category to group changes in the changelog.\n BC breaks It is very important to note if your change introduces backwards incompatible changes (also referred to as \u0026ldquo;backward compatiblity breaks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;BC breaks\u0026rdquo;).\nHere are some examples of changes that can be considered breaking changes:\n Change any public method signature in any class (rename, change its return type or structure, remove a parameter, or change its type). Change any public property in any class. Rename, move, or delete any class or class namespace. Add new requirements (like dropping support for old versions of PHP or browsers, requiring new server-side libraries, etc.) Replace any subsystem (like updating libraries to new major versions or replacing a library with another).  Be aware that introducing a breaking change, even when justified, may force maintainers to reject your Pull Request. Deprecations If your code introduces deprecations, please note them here.\nFixed ticket If your Pull Request resolves an existing issue, please note it using the magic word \u0026ldquo;Fixes\u0026rdquo;, followed by the issue number, like this: Fixes #12314.\nUsing the appropriate syntax will link your Pull Request to that issue, and will automatically close it once your Pull Request is merged. If no issue is linked to your Pull Request, maintainers might ask you to create one. This helps the team track what goes in a release and the status of each individual change.\nHow to test In addition to being code reviewed, each individual contribution is manually verified by PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s QA team. In order to effectively confirm that your change doesn\u0026rsquo;t introduce new errors, please describe how to best verify that your change does what you expect it to do. Feel free to write as much details as you can outside the table if needed.\nThink about tests!\nIncluding automated tests (unit, integration or functional) that verify your changes can significantly increase the chances that your Pull Request is accepted.\n Possible impacts PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s QA team will not only verify the right behavior of your change but also verify that other related parts of the software are still working as expected. For example modifying a CSS class can disrupt the display of all the web pages which rely on it. Please mention all the impacts you are aware of that need to be checked in order to help QA team find and verify all of them.\n"

Here are some good examples:\n Fix fatal error when trying to sign up on Chrome Prevent users from deleting their own profile on the users listing Reduce memory usage on the Front Office home Add button to close the welcome message on first login Migrate product page to Symfony  Why this is important?\nPull Requests titles are used to build the Changelog we publish on each release. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example.\n The Pull Request form Once you have chosen a title for your Pull Request, you are asked to fill out the Pull Request table. Filling it out properly is mandatory.\nAlong other reasons, it helps maintainers:\n Make sure that the change works as expected Track when a change fixes a known issue Track if a change introduced affects backwards compatibility (BC breaks) Build the change log (changes are grouped by type and category).  Let\u0026rsquo;s see what each of the rows is for.\nBranch This part is needed to cross-check that your PR targets the branch that you intended. Just write the name of the target branch, as explained in Supported branches.\nDescription Describing your change and the reasoning behind it is extremely important for it to be reviewed and approved. Explain, in as much detail as you can, what did you change and why.\nIf you need space, just write a short summary about your change in the table, then describe in more detail below it. You are also encouraged to add links, files, screenshots\u0026hellip; anything that can help reviewers understand why the change is needed, and why it\u0026rsquo;s valid.\nTip: If you find yourself short on inspiration, use this Pull Request as an example. Type \u0026amp; Category Type is used to describe what kind of a change your Pull Request is. Refer to the following table to choose the most appropriate:\n   Type Scope     bug fix The changes fix a bug.   improvement The changes improve an already existing feature (eg. cosmetic or UX changes, performance improvement, etc).   new feature The changes introduce a behavior that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before (eg. add a button, a new page, a new block\u0026hellip;)   refacto The changes only refactor code, without changing any of its side effects.    The category is the main part of the project affected by your changes. Choose the code that most closely describes your change:\n   Code Scope     FO The changes impact the Front Office   BO The changes impact the Back Office   IN The changes impact the Installer   WS The changes impact the Web Services   CO The changes impact the Core (non-visible functionality)   LO The changes impact localization functionality   TE The changes impact automated tests   ME The changes only import a git branch into another (eg. merge maintenance branch into develop)   PM The changes are related to project management (eg. edit Github pull request form)    Remember, this is only needed for the Pull Request form, not for your commit messages. Why is this important?\nWe use type \u0026amp; category to group changes in the changelog.\n BC breaks It is very important to note if your change introduces backwards incompatible changes (also referred to as \u0026ldquo;backward compatiblity breaks\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;BC breaks\u0026rdquo;).\nHere are some examples of changes that can be considered breaking changes:\n Change any public method signature in any class (rename, change its return type or structure, remove a parameter, or change its type). Change any public property in any class. Rename, move, or delete any class or class namespace. Add new requirements (like dropping support for old versions of PHP or browsers, requiring new server-side libraries, etc.) Replace any subsystem (like updating libraries to new major versions or replacing a library with another).  Be aware that introducing a breaking change, even when justified, may force maintainers to reject your Pull Request. Deprecations If your code introduces deprecations, please note them here.\nFixed ticket If your Pull Request resolves an existing issue, please note it using the magic word \u0026ldquo;Fixes\u0026rdquo;, followed by the issue number, like this: Fixes #12314.\nUsing the appropriate syntax will link your Pull Request to that issue, and will automatically close it once your Pull Request is merged. If no issue is linked to your Pull Request, maintainers might ask you to create one. This helps the team track what goes in a release and the status of each individual change.\nHow to test In addition to being code reviewed, each individual contribution is manually verified by PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s QA team. In order to effectively confirm that your change doesn\u0026rsquo;t introduce new errors, please describe how to best verify that your change does what you expect it to do. Feel free to write as much details as you can outside the table if needed.\nThink about tests!\nIncluding automated tests (unit, integration or functional) that verify your changes can significantly increase the chances that your Pull Request is accepted.\n Possible impacts PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s QA team will not only verify the right behavior of your change but also verify that other related parts of the software are still working as expected. For example modifying a CSS class can disrupt the display of all the web pages which rely on it. Please mention all the impacts you are aware of that need to be checked in order to help QA team find and verify all of them.\n"

	"content": "How to migrate to PrestaShop 1.7 Manual migration - Process details We will use the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) process to complete a migration, a concept usually applied to data warehouses.\nThe database structure may change with each new release of PrestaShop, but major versions may also imply features being replaced, preventing a shop to be smoothly upgraded in some cases. For these shops, a migration is a solution to be able to keep up with new releases.\nWe will cover the 3 main steps in this chapter:\n Extract data to be transfered Add / modify / delete some values if needed Import data on the new shop  Exporting data from the source In difference with an upgrade, we won’t modify the database directly. We need to export the data first. We use CSV files here, the most compatible and generic format.\nExporting data can be done\n Via the PrestaShop administration panel, With your MySQL client.  Depending on the way you export your data, you won’t get the same amount of data in your exports.\nLight - Via the administration panel Exporting data is quite straightforward. On each controller dedicated to the data you want to export, you will find action buttons at the top right of the page:\n Export button in action bar   For instance for your products on PrestaShop 1.7:  Action bar localization   Clicking on the “Export” button will make your browser download a CSV file, which contains the complete product list with the columns displayed on the page.\nWith the same process, you can export the following data:\n (Brand) Addresses (Customer) Addresses (Product) Attributes Brands Carts Categories Customers (Product) Features Orders Stocks Suppliers  The extraction will contain values for the current language. If your shop is multilang, you must switch your lang in your employee configuration (accessible from the top right corner of the page) and repeat the extraction. This method is limited to the displayed details (= what you see on the table), thus can be far from being exhaustive. In the case you want more or all columns, you may prefer to proceed manually with your own SQL client.\nComplete - Via a MySQL client Advanced users can use their own client to extract data in CSV. This option give full control on the data to export.\nChoosing an extraction in CSV will allow you to bring changes easily with a spreadsheet editor, like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.\nphpMyAdmin On phpMyAdmin, exporting in CSV can be done on the same page as the classic SQL dump.\nQuick and complete export (recommended) This step can be completed straightforwardly by exporting all tables in a single call. Click on your database, then the “Export” button to start:\n Note the breadcrumb in the header will tell you if you are in a database or a table context. If you clicked on this button by mistake while being on a table, you will end on the export of a specific table as titled on this screenshot:\n Whatever you choose between exporting the whole database in a single call or exporting your tables one by one, you must choose to export in “CSV” or “CSV for MS Excel”.\nThe available options will be updated:\n If you want to export several tables at the same time, this can be done by selecting them from the list. The tables running with your shop start with the prefix given in your shop configuration (by default ps_). If one of them does not start with this prefix, it is unlikely concerned by the migration and can be ignored.\nThese tables can be ignored as well:\n access: As said, permissions have been reworked and have to be reset. configuration. You new shop already has a new configuration, and overwriting it with the old shop content is a bad idea. currency: Its content will be generated by during another step. lang: Its content will be generated by during another step. module_access: Structure is reworked with the new permission system. As it can’t be migrated easily, we recommend to reconfigure them manually. tab: This table contains the admin controllers accessible on your backoffice. As its values are mainly managed by PrestaShop, do not alter the content of the new shop. tab_lang: Related to tab and already managed by PrestaShop.  To avoid a single CSV file to be returned with all your tables in it, check the option “Export tables as separate files”. You will get a Zip file instead, containing one CSV file for each table.\nFinally, we advise to check the option “Put columns names in the first row”. This will be useful in the next step when your data will need to be modified.\nPersonalized export from custom SQL requests We explained how to export all your tables to make sure you keep as much data as possible.\nIf you get your data from another CMS or prefer to proceed with your own method, you can run a custom SQL query to get all the information you need. This option is useful if you plan to import your data with the import feature of PrestaShop.\nAs an example here is a SQL request to get the main product details, along with the texts corresponding to the first language of the first shop:\nSELECTp.*,pl.*FROM`ps_product`pJOIN`ps_product_lang`plONp.id_product=pl.id_productANDpl.id_lang=1ANDpl.id_shop=1GROUPBYpl.id_productIf the result fits your needs, you can export it with the “export” button available at the bottom of the page.\n mysqldump If you used mysqldump for your backups, there is also an option for extracting your data in CSV files, as described in the documentation. However, our tests have shown that method is far from being easy.\nExample for exporting the table ps_product:\nmysqldump -h127.0.0.1 -P3307 -uroot -p -T/var/lib/mysql-files --fields-enclosed-by=\\\u0026#34; --fields-terminated-by=\\; prestashop16 ps_product Several notes about mysqldump with CSV files:\n Make sure you set the option --fields-terminated-by with the separators you want The header containing column names is missing from the .txt file and have to be manually inserted  Here is an extract of the product table, with demonstration data. Only the data is present and we need to add the column names.\n CSV from mysqldump without header   Look at the SQL file provided with the TXT file, or run a DESCRIBE of the table.\nmysql\u0026gt;DESCRIBEprestashop16.ps_product;You should expect the following result before proceeding to the next table:\n CSV from mysqldump with header    You can rename the generated .txt files with the .csv extension to avoid confusion. If you are connected to a remote MySQL server: switching on CSV export will write on the remote filesystem and not on the client one. That’s why writing on a nonexistent or disallowed folder may trigger this error:  mysqldump: Got error: 1290: The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement when executing \u0026#39;SELECT INTO OUTFILE\u0026#39; If you want to know in which folder you can export the files, run the SQL request:\nmysql\u0026gt;SHOWVARIABLESLIKE\u0026#34;secure_file_priv\u0026#34;;Updating the data Get changes between source and destination databases Now you have retrieved your data from the production shop, you have to adapt it to the new structure before inserting it on your new database.\nAn efficient way to get the changes is getting a database structure diff between the 2 running shops. MySQL provides another tool for this called mysqldiff.\nNote this utility may be not immediately available on your environment, even if you have the mysql client installed. For instance on Ubuntu, an additional package needs to be installed:\napt install mysql-utilities This tool can be run anywhere, as long as you can access both servers \u0026amp; databases. The basic use of this command requires the following parameters:\nmysqldiff --server1=user:pass@host:port:socket --server2=user:pass@host:port:socket db3:db4 You need to provide the credentials to your MySQL servers. If the source and the destination databases are on the same server, the --server2 parameter can be omitted. db3 and db4 are respectively the source and the destination databases of your data.\nGetting the structure diff will require additional options, as provided in this example:\nmysqldiff --server1=root:xxxx@127.0.0.1:3307 --changes-for=server1 --skip-table-options --force prestashop16:prestashop  All our databases are on the same server, that’s why only --server1 is provided, We want to know what are the changes to apply on the 1.6 version to fit the 1.7 structure, so we need --changes-for=server1 We only need structure changes. --skip-table-options removes diff about autoincrement etc. By default mysqldiff will only tell you the databases are not the same and will return immediately. Providing --force will make the tool print out details about the differences found.  A example of output is available in https://gist.github.com/Quetzacoalt91/9cef61ebbf12c139f44d27035d3cb1fd. The changes are extracted from a diff structure between a PrestaShop 1.6.1.18 database and another one under PrestaShop 1.7.3.2.\nIt appears the structure from PrestaShop has not drastically changed from 1.6 versions, although some columns type has evolved. Preparing your data for PrestaShop 1.7 should not need too many changes on your CSV files.\nApplying structure change This step has to be reproduced as many times as you have tables waiting to be migrated. The import step will be easier if you make sure the data you transfer fits the destination structure. This chapter will help to identify the changes to apply depending on the diff created during the previous step.\nA few notes:\n Not all differences require a change in your data, Basic changes can be done using spreadsheet editor, Complex modifications will require manual work.  New column Any new column added to the database requires the same work on your CSV file. Check on the new shop what default value applies to the new column, by checking in the following order:\n The database schema, The ObjectModel (folder classes of PrestaShop), The Entity (folder src/PrestaShopBundle/Entity).  Example with the table cart:\n--- `prestashop16`.`ps_cart` +++ `prestashop`.`ps_cart` @@ -18,6 +18,7 @@  `allow_seperated_package` tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, `date_add` datetime NOT NULL, `date_upd` datetime NOT NULL, + `checkout_session_data` mediumtext, [...] Before:  CSV before column addition   After:  CSV with new column   In this example the new column checkout_session_data has no default value and the existing data on our PrestaShop displays an empty column. As the column allows null values, we keep all rows empty.\nColumn has the same type, but not the same size Example with address:\n- `lastname` varchar(32) NOT NULL, + `lastname` varchar(255) NOT NULL, If a column keeps its type but only increases its size, it does not require any change on your side. The new version offers more room to your text before being truncated.\nYou will probably notice the same change on your table keys:\n- `id_attribute_group` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, + `id_attribute_group` int(11) NOT NULL, This change does not imply anything on your side. This is a preliminary work for building relations between our tables.\nColumn removed This kind of change is easier than adding a column.\n- `scenes` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;, Open the related CSV, remove the column and save.\nHowever keep in mind in some cases the column may have been moved to another table. If this occurs, you will have to move the content of your column to another CSV.\nAn example is available for the table store, some columns have been moved to the table store_lang to allow localized data to be used. Data needs to be moved to a new CSV, and duplicated as many time as you have languages installed on your shop.\nDefault value disappeared - `position` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, + `position` int(11) NOT NULL, Here again, nothing to worry about, as there is no change needed on your data. The default value is now managed by the ORM. However, if the previous version did not show NOT NULL, this could require you to add a default value on the empty rows.\nPrimary key / unique index updates If the primary key or one unique key on a table evolves / is added, the import of your existing data can fail if it doesn’t respect the new unicity rules.\n- PRIMARY KEY (`id_feature`,`id_product`), + PRIMARY KEY (`id_feature`,`id_product`,`id_feature_value`), + UNIQUE KEY `name_UNIQUE` (`name`), If you see this kind of diff, check that you do not have the same group of values more than once. Is is more likely to happen if a column is removed from a column group, or if a key is added.\nRedirection for disabled products This change is specific to the table product.\n- `redirect_type` enum(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;404\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;301\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;302\u0026#39;) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, - `id_product_redirected` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, + `redirect_type` enum(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;404\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;301-product\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;302-product\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;301-category\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;302-category\u0026#39;) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, + `id_type_redirected` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, When a product is disabled, the merchant can choose to which other page customers will be redirected to if they try to access it. On PrestaShop 1.7 the number of options has increased, and a redirection to a category page is now possible.\nFor data coming from PrestaShop 1.6, existing redirections must be updated.\n Column redirect_type:     Old value New value     301 301-product   302 302-product     Column id_product_redirected: Name is now id_type_redirected  If you exported your data in CSV, doing this change will be easy with a spreadsheet editor, like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. Just make sure to keep the same file extension while saving.\nHere is an example before and after the requested update (changes appear in green).\nBefore (Original state):  After:  Shop details You will notice that in the shop table the column id_theme has been replaced by theme_name. PrestaShop does not store data about theme in dedicated tables anymore. The only information remaining is the theme name used by each shop.\nAs migrating to PrestaShop 1.7 implies losing the theme used on the shop in production, just write “classic” in this column for each shop.\nBefore:  After:  IDs in CSV files We assume that you will want to overwrite the demonstration data with the data you exported from the old shop. Leaving your IDs intact will replace any existing data with the same ID.\nIf you want to add the extracted data without overriding the existing records on the new shop, you should take care of removing the IDs from your CSV files, or ignore them during the import.\nPreparing the destination shop Make sure to select dont install demo data when installing the shop\n Dont install demo data   Install languages If you are selling in several countries, additional languages have to be reinstalled on the new shop. This can be done in International \u0026gt; Localization \u0026gt; Import a localization pack.\nAlso, make sure the IDs of your langs match on the source shop.\n Checking IDs of installed languages on a shop   This is an example of shop waiting to be migrated. As we can see, there is a discontinuity on the languages IDs. To reproduce these gaps, you can add unneeded languages you will remove in a second time.\nImporting data Unlike a restore, we will only import content here, no table structure will be modified. In a migration, the data imported must fit the new structure and not the old one.\nVia a MySQL client PHPMyAdmin PHPMyAdmin also provides a tool to import the data you previously modified into your tables.\nUnlike the export step, we recommend you to proceed with tables one by one.\nWe assume you want to get rid of the demonstration data of the destination shop, which also makes the import less risky regarding potential duplicate identifiers.\n Emptying demo data  First, clean the table from its content with a TRUNCATE action. As PHPMyAdmin does not allow this step before importing your data, you have to execute it manually. Go to the operations panel of your table.\n At the bottom of the page, you will find the critical operations available. As they are destructive for the existing data, they can’t be easily found and are written in red.\n If PHPMyAdmin suggests to check the foreign keys, you can disable it. As you won’t import all your tables in a single call, you obviously cannot ensure that your relations will be fine during the process.\n Importing data  Now the table has been cleaned from demonstration content, you can import the data from the old shop. Go to the Import tab from your table.\n A form will appear to let you customize your import. The default configuration expects a SQL file to run, so we will have several options to change as shown on the screenshot.\n  Start by selecting your CSV file. The second option to modify will be the format. Choose “CSV” or “CSV for MS Excel”. Skip the first line of your file. We had the column names in the first line to make our file edition easier, but we do not want to import it in the database. Disable the foreign key checks. We know some relations don’t exist yet, because they won’t be imported at the same time. Double check the CSV settings (separators). A wrong value will make your CSV file unparsable.  Finally, click on “Go”. If everything goes well, you will get a confirmation page like this:\n If not, check the error message. An error about the CSV content could be fixed by other import settings, while an SQL error will require you to fix your data.\nRepeat the process as many times as you have CSV files.\nVia the import feature of PrestaShop Importing your data can also be done via the PrestaShop administration panel.\nThat solution is best when your data does not come from another PrestaShop, or if you got your data from customized SQL requests.\nIt is convenient thanks to its interface and its management of unprovided columns. Unlike imports with a MySQL client, the PrestaShop import feature will always be able to apply the default values for a missing information.\nOn the new shop, reach the controller Advanced parameters \u0026gt; Import.\n This controller will allow you to import the following data:\n Categories Products Combinations Customers Addresses Brands Suppliers Alias Store contacts  When possible, try to have only one CSV file per data category ready to be imported. This depends on the file size and the upload size allowed by your server configuration. If uploading a single CSV file is impossible, split it in half and try again.\nYou have to go through the configuration for each import, which can be tedious in some cases. For instance, if the provided columns do not match the default schema.\nNote: Like for the export, each data category must be imported several times if your shop is multi-language – once per language. Forcing the IDs provided by the CSV file will help you link your localized data with the original one.\nImport main configuration To import data, start by uploading your CSV file. It will be done automatically when you select your file from the filesystem.\nBefore CSV selection or upload:\n Some warnings may be displayed depending on the type of data to import. They can provide useful advice about forbidden or allowed rules.\nOnce a CSV is selected:\n Double check the field \u0026amp; multiple-value options for your CSV structure. Default values should work in most of case, but incorrect values will make the import fail.\nChecking the “Delete all \u0026lt;data\u0026gt; before import” (see screenshot above) option could be useful to clean the demonstration content from your shop before importing your data. But if you export several CSV of the same type of data, make sure to disable it before proceeding with the second and following files.\nColumn assignment The second step allows you to link the old columns with the new ones.\n In case a column from the CSV should not be taken in account, you can ask PrestaShop to bypass it by choosing the first option of the list: “Ignore this column”.\nWhen you’re ready to proceed, click on “Import”.\nImport progress From that moment, you can just wait for the process to complete. The time it will take depends on the number of lines to import, and the chosen options.\n To avoid reaching the maximum execution time of a request, the process will divide your data in several chunks which will be processed in separate HTTP requests.\nThe import process will start by checking the time needed to process one chunk. Depending on the result, more or less objects will be handled during the next HTTP requests. This gives a nice balance between performance and stability.\nImages Depending on how you migrated your data, (i.e without the import feature of PrestaShop), your images may be missing from the new shop. If they are not present, you may want to retrieve them from the old.\nImages are stored on the filesystem and their link to a product is stored in the database. Restoring them depends on how you migrated your data:\n You kept the same IDs when you imported the products  If the IDs are exactly the same between the two shops, copying the folder `/img/p` will be enough to get the images.\nAlso, you must transfer the data of the tables \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_lang / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_shop in which the link between your images and products IDs is stored.\n The product IDs have changed in database  The images can be retrieved as well, but this will require some changes.\nFirst, copy the folder `/img/p` to get the images on the new shop filesystem.\nThen, you will have to transfer and adapt the data of the tables \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_lang / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_shop.\nThe tables \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;image and \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;image_shop contain a column which is a reference to product IDs. As they have changed on the new shop, you must update these identifiers in order to match the new values.\nThis work can be tedious, that’s why we recommend migrating your data on the new shop by removing the existing data at the same time.\n Generate thumbnails  Products images thumbnails must be regenerated in order to be displayed properly on the product page, checkout funnel etc.\nGo to Design \u0026gt; Image settings \u0026gt; Regenerate thumbnails to regenerate all the missing sizes.\nAttachments Like the images, these folders need to be copied on the new server:\n  /download (Contains product attachments)\n  /upload (Contains customer uploads)\n  Like for the images, you will have to adapt some content in your database if you could not keep the original product IDs.\n  \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;product_attachment\n  \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;customization\n  \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;customization_data\n  Generate search index Imported products are not immediately available for search to your customers. You must refresh the search index to make them available.\nGo to Shop parameters \u0026gt; Search \u0026gt; Indexing and click on “Add missing product to the index”.\nOther migration options for developers The manual process explained how to export and import data with CSV files from database. If you are a developer and you are willing to build your own tools for migrations, other ways exist to get the business data.\nThe following interfaces will make your tools more efficient and stable than a simple CSV extraction. You can add values stored elsewhere than in the database, handle your own format, and handle many more objects from the source shop.\nObject Models Object Model is an interface in the PHP codebase used by PrestaShop developers to request the database.\nThis can be used while developing a module responsible of the export and/or import of the objects from/to the database.\nFor more details, see the page dedicated to ObjectModels\nWeb service (API) The webservice API is another way to retrieve or store data in PrestaShop.\nIt must be enabled from the administration panel before being accessible. See the doc for more details: https://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS17/Webservice\nOnce ready, an API will be available for all the ressources enabled for your key. Basically, the web-service in another interface for object models, themselves interfacing the database.\nYou can use it to retrieve all your products, categories etc from the first shop, and re-inserting them in the other shop without many changes.\nThis option is interesting for people looking for making the process automatic, because:\n the webservice has barely changed since PrestaShop 1.5, you get all the properties of a given object, if a property is multi-lang, you will get the value or a link to another resource for each lang, you can get the images URL of a resource (i.e product), while you can’t find directly from a database column, getting a resource, or inserting one, is done by manipulating XMLs.  Useful links:\n Learning how-to use the webservice API Getting a list of all available ressources, ready for import/export  Migration modules and services Community module Although this solution is not made by PrestaShop, it follows the concept of export / import presented here and has been recommended several time on discussion platforms like the forum.\nThat solution is a module called “MigrationPro” and is available on the Marketplace:\nhttps://addons.prestashop.com/en/data-migration-backup/8934-migrationpro-prestashop-to-prestashop-migration-tool.html\nIt bundles two different modules to install on your old and new shop, respectively responsible of the export and import of the business data. It uses the object models to interact with the database.\nSupport service As well as for the upgrade, you can also ask our support team to proceed with the migration for you.\nYour data will be migrated and your compatible modules will be transferred. As the theme will be lost, you get instead a discount on themes available on the Marketplace. This option is useful for merchants who chose to use an existing theme instead of developing theirs.\nYou can subscribe for this service on the marketplace:\nhttps://addons.prestashop.com/en/support/18689-upgrade-pack-prestashop.html\nMany agencies and freelancers propose this kind of service and some of them are certainly in your area.\n"

This option is useful if you plan to import your data with the import feature of PrestaShop.\nAs an example here is a SQL request to get the main product details, along with the texts corresponding to the first language of the first shop:\nSELECTp.*,pl.*FROM`ps_product`pJOIN`ps_product_lang`plONp.id_product=pl.id_productANDpl.id_lang=1ANDpl.id_shop=1GROUPBYpl.id_productIf the result fits your needs, you can export it with the “export” button available at the bottom of the page.\n mysqldump If you used mysqldump for your backups, there is also an option for extracting your data in CSV files, as described in the documentation. However, our tests have shown that method is far from being easy.\nExample for exporting the table ps_product:\nmysqldump -h127.0.0.1 -P3307 -uroot -p -T/var/lib/mysql-files --fields-enclosed-by=\\\u0026#34; --fields-terminated-by=\\; prestashop16 ps_product Several notes about mysqldump with CSV files:\n Make sure you set the option --fields-terminated-by with the separators you want The header containing column names is missing from the .txt file and have to be manually inserted  Here is an extract of the product table, with demonstration data. Only the data is present and we need to add the column names.\n CSV from mysqldump without header   Look at the SQL file provided with the TXT file, or run a DESCRIBE of the table.\nmysql\u0026gt;DESCRIBEprestashop16.ps_product;You should expect the following result before proceeding to the next table:\n CSV from mysqldump with header    You can rename the generated .txt files with the .csv extension to avoid confusion. If you are connected to a remote MySQL server: switching on CSV export will write on the remote filesystem and not on the client one. That’s why writing on a nonexistent or disallowed folder may trigger this error:  mysqldump: Got error: 1290: The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement when executing \u0026#39;SELECT INTO OUTFILE\u0026#39; If you want to know in which folder you can export the files, run the SQL request:\nmysql\u0026gt;SHOWVARIABLESLIKE\u0026#34;secure_file_priv\u0026#34;;Updating the data Get changes between source and destination databases Now you have retrieved your data from the production shop, you have to adapt it to the new structure before inserting it on your new database.\nAn efficient way to get the changes is getting a database structure diff between the 2 running shops. MySQL provides another tool for this called mysqldiff.\nNote this utility may be not immediately available on your environment, even if you have the mysql client installed. For instance on Ubuntu, an additional package needs to be installed:\napt install mysql-utilities This tool can be run anywhere, as long as you can access both servers \u0026amp; databases. The basic use of this command requires the following parameters:\nmysqldiff --server1=user:pass@host:port:socket --server2=user:pass@host:port:socket db3:db4 You need to provide the credentials to your MySQL servers. If the source and the destination databases are on the same server, the --server2 parameter can be omitted. db3 and db4 are respectively the source and the destination databases of your data.\nGetting the structure diff will require additional options, as provided in this example:\nmysqldiff --server1=root:xxxx@127.0.0.1:3307 --changes-for=server1 --skip-table-options --force prestashop16:prestashop  All our databases are on the same server, that’s why only --server1 is provided, We want to know what are the changes to apply on the 1.6 version to fit the 1.7 structure, so we need --changes-for=server1 We only need structure changes. --skip-table-options removes diff about autoincrement etc. By default mysqldiff will only tell you the databases are not the same and will return immediately. Providing --force will make the tool print out details about the differences found.  A example of output is available in https://gist.github.com/Quetzacoalt91/9cef61ebbf12c139f44d27035d3cb1fd. The changes are extracted from a diff structure between a PrestaShop 1.6.1.18 database and another one under PrestaShop 1.7.3.2.\nIt appears the structure from PrestaShop has not drastically changed from 1.6 versions, although some columns type has evolved. Preparing your data for PrestaShop 1.7 should not need too many changes on your CSV files.\nApplying structure change This step has to be reproduced as many times as you have tables waiting to be migrated. The import step will be easier if you make sure the data you transfer fits the destination structure. This chapter will help to identify the changes to apply depending on the diff created during the previous step.\nA few notes:\n Not all differences require a change in your data, Basic changes can be done using spreadsheet editor, Complex modifications will require manual work.  New column Any new column added to the database requires the same work on your CSV file. Check on the new shop what default value applies to the new column, by checking in the following order:\n The database schema, The ObjectModel (folder classes of PrestaShop), The Entity (folder src/PrestaShopBundle/Entity).  Example with the table cart:\n--- `prestashop16`.`ps_cart` +++ `prestashop`.`ps_cart` @@ -18,6 +18,7 @@  `allow_seperated_package` tinyint(1) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, `date_add` datetime NOT NULL, `date_upd` datetime NOT NULL, + `checkout_session_data` mediumtext, [...] Before:  CSV before column addition   After:  CSV with new column   In this example the new column checkout_session_data has no default value and the existing data on our PrestaShop displays an empty column. As the column allows null values, we keep all rows empty.\nColumn has the same type, but not the same size Example with address:\n- `lastname` varchar(32) NOT NULL, + `lastname` varchar(255) NOT NULL, If a column keeps its type but only increases its size, it does not require any change on your side. The new version offers more room to your text before being truncated.\nYou will probably notice the same change on your table keys:\n- `id_attribute_group` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL, + `id_attribute_group` int(11) NOT NULL, This change does not imply anything on your side. This is a preliminary work for building relations between our tables.\nColumn removed This kind of change is easier than adding a column.\n- `scenes` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;, Open the related CSV, remove the column and save.\nHowever keep in mind in some cases the column may have been moved to another table. If this occurs, you will have to move the content of your column to another CSV.\nAn example is available for the table store, some columns have been moved to the table store_lang to allow localized data to be used. Data needs to be moved to a new CSV, and duplicated as many time as you have languages installed on your shop.\nDefault value disappeared - `position` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, + `position` int(11) NOT NULL, Here again, nothing to worry about, as there is no change needed on your data. The default value is now managed by the ORM. However, if the previous version did not show NOT NULL, this could require you to add a default value on the empty rows.\nPrimary key / unique index updates If the primary key or one unique key on a table evolves / is added, the import of your existing data can fail if it doesn’t respect the new unicity rules.\n- PRIMARY KEY (`id_feature`,`id_product`), + PRIMARY KEY (`id_feature`,`id_product`,`id_feature_value`), + UNIQUE KEY `name_UNIQUE` (`name`), If you see this kind of diff, check that you do not have the same group of values more than once. Is is more likely to happen if a column is removed from a column group, or if a key is added.\nRedirection for disabled products This change is specific to the table product.\n- `redirect_type` enum(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;404\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;301\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;302\u0026#39;) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, - `id_product_redirected` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, + `redirect_type` enum(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;404\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;301-product\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;302-product\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;301-category\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;302-category\u0026#39;) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, + `id_type_redirected` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;, When a product is disabled, the merchant can choose to which other page customers will be redirected to if they try to access it. On PrestaShop 1.7 the number of options has increased, and a redirection to a category page is now possible.\nFor data coming from PrestaShop 1.6, existing redirections must be updated.\n Column redirect_type:     Old value New value     301 301-product   302 302-product     Column id_product_redirected: Name is now id_type_redirected  If you exported your data in CSV, doing this change will be easy with a spreadsheet editor, like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc. Just make sure to keep the same file extension while saving.\nHere is an example before and after the requested update (changes appear in green).\nBefore (Original state):  After:  Shop details You will notice that in the shop table the column id_theme has been replaced by theme_name. PrestaShop does not store data about theme in dedicated tables anymore. The only information remaining is the theme name used by each shop.\nAs migrating to PrestaShop 1.7 implies losing the theme used on the shop in production, just write “classic” in this column for each shop.\nBefore:  After:  IDs in CSV files We assume that you will want to overwrite the demonstration data with the data you exported from the old shop. Leaving your IDs intact will replace any existing data with the same ID.\nIf you want to add the extracted data without overriding the existing records on the new shop, you should take care of removing the IDs from your CSV files, or ignore them during the import.\nPreparing the destination shop Make sure to select dont install demo data when installing the shop\n Dont install demo data   Install languages If you are selling in several countries, additional languages have to be reinstalled on the new shop. This can be done in International \u0026gt; Localization \u0026gt; Import a localization pack.\nAlso, make sure the IDs of your langs match on the source shop.\n Checking IDs of installed languages on a shop   This is an example of shop waiting to be migrated. As we can see, there is a discontinuity on the languages IDs. To reproduce these gaps, you can add unneeded languages you will remove in a second time.\nImporting data Unlike a restore, we will only import content here, no table structure will be modified. In a migration, the data imported must fit the new structure and not the old one.\nVia a MySQL client PHPMyAdmin PHPMyAdmin also provides a tool to import the data you previously modified into your tables.\nUnlike the export step, we recommend you to proceed with tables one by one.\nWe assume you want to get rid of the demonstration data of the destination shop, which also makes the import less risky regarding potential duplicate identifiers.\n Emptying demo data  First, clean the table from its content with a TRUNCATE action. As PHPMyAdmin does not allow this step before importing your data, you have to execute it manually. Go to the operations panel of your table.\n At the bottom of the page, you will find the critical operations available. As they are destructive for the existing data, they can’t be easily found and are written in red.\n If PHPMyAdmin suggests to check the foreign keys, you can disable it. As you won’t import all your tables in a single call, you obviously cannot ensure that your relations will be fine during the process.\n Importing data  Now the table has been cleaned from demonstration content, you can import the data from the old shop. Go to the Import tab from your table.\n A form will appear to let you customize your import. The default configuration expects a SQL file to run, so we will have several options to change as shown on the screenshot.\n  Start by selecting your CSV file. The second option to modify will be the format. Choose “CSV” or “CSV for MS Excel”. Skip the first line of your file. We had the column names in the first line to make our file edition easier, but we do not want to import it in the database. Disable the foreign key checks. We know some relations don’t exist yet, because they won’t be imported at the same time. Double check the CSV settings (separators). A wrong value will make your CSV file unparsable.  Finally, click on “Go”. If everything goes well, you will get a confirmation page like this:\n If not, check the error message. An error about the CSV content could be fixed by other import settings, while an SQL error will require you to fix your data.\nRepeat the process as many times as you have CSV files.\nVia the import feature of PrestaShop Importing your data can also be done via the PrestaShop administration panel.\nThat solution is best when your data does not come from another PrestaShop, or if you got your data from customized SQL requests.\nIt is convenient thanks to its interface and its management of unprovided columns. Unlike imports with a MySQL client, the PrestaShop import feature will always be able to apply the default values for a missing information.\nOn the new shop, reach the controller Advanced parameters \u0026gt; Import.\n This controller will allow you to import the following data:\n Categories Products Combinations Customers Addresses Brands Suppliers Alias Store contacts  When possible, try to have only one CSV file per data category ready to be imported. This depends on the file size and the upload size allowed by your server configuration. If uploading a single CSV file is impossible, split it in half and try again.\nYou have to go through the configuration for each import, which can be tedious in some cases. For instance, if the provided columns do not match the default schema.\nNote: Like for the export, each data category must be imported several times if your shop is multi-language – once per language. Forcing the IDs provided by the CSV file will help you link your localized data with the original one.\nImport main configuration To import data, start by uploading your CSV file. It will be done automatically when you select your file from the filesystem.\nBefore CSV selection or upload:\n Some warnings may be displayed depending on the type of data to import. They can provide useful advice about forbidden or allowed rules.\nOnce a CSV is selected:\n Double check the field \u0026amp; multiple-value options for your CSV structure. Default values should work in most of case, but incorrect values will make the import fail.\nChecking the “Delete all \u0026lt;data\u0026gt; before import” (see screenshot above) option could be useful to clean the demonstration content from your shop before importing your data. But if you export several CSV of the same type of data, make sure to disable it before proceeding with the second and following files.\nColumn assignment The second step allows you to link the old columns with the new ones.\n In case a column from the CSV should not be taken in account, you can ask PrestaShop to bypass it by choosing the first option of the list: “Ignore this column”.\nWhen you’re ready to proceed, click on “Import”.\nImport progress From that moment, you can just wait for the process to complete. The time it will take depends on the number of lines to import, and the chosen options.\n To avoid reaching the maximum execution time of a request, the process will divide your data in several chunks which will be processed in separate HTTP requests.\nThe import process will start by checking the time needed to process one chunk. Depending on the result, more or less objects will be handled during the next HTTP requests. This gives a nice balance between performance and stability.\nImages Depending on how you migrated your data, (i.e without the import feature of PrestaShop), your images may be missing from the new shop. If they are not present, you may want to retrieve them from the old.\nImages are stored on the filesystem and their link to a product is stored in the database. Restoring them depends on how you migrated your data:\n You kept the same IDs when you imported the products  If the IDs are exactly the same between the two shops, copying the folder `/img/p` will be enough to get the images.\nAlso, you must transfer the data of the tables \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_lang / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_shop in which the link between your images and products IDs is stored.\n The product IDs have changed in database  The images can be retrieved as well, but this will require some changes.\nFirst, copy the folder `/img/p` to get the images on the new shop filesystem.\nThen, you will have to transfer and adapt the data of the tables \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_lang / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images / \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;images_shop.\nThe tables \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;image and \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;image_shop contain a column which is a reference to product IDs. As they have changed on the new shop, you must update these identifiers in order to match the new values.\nThis work can be tedious, that’s why we recommend migrating your data on the new shop by removing the existing data at the same time.\n Generate thumbnails  Products images thumbnails must be regenerated in order to be displayed properly on the product page, checkout funnel etc.\nGo to Design \u0026gt; Image settings \u0026gt; Regenerate thumbnails to regenerate all the missing sizes.\nAttachments Like the images, these folders need to be copied on the new server:\n  /download (Contains product attachments)\n  /upload (Contains customer uploads)\n  Like for the images, you will have to adapt some content in your database if you could not keep the original product IDs.\n  \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;product_attachment\n  \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;customization\n  \u0026lt;PREFIX\u0026gt;customization_data\n  Generate search index Imported products are not immediately available for search to your customers. You must refresh the search index to make them available.\nGo to Shop parameters \u0026gt; Search \u0026gt; Indexing and click on “Add missing product to the index”.\nOther migration options for developers The manual process explained how to export and import data with CSV files from database. If you are a developer and you are willing to build your own tools for migrations, other ways exist to get the business data.\nThe following interfaces will make your tools more efficient and stable than a simple CSV extraction. You can add values stored elsewhere than in the database, handle your own format, and handle many more objects from the source shop.\nObject Models Object Model is an interface in the PHP codebase used by PrestaShop developers to request the database.\nThis can be used while developing a module responsible of the export and/or import of the objects from/to the database.\nFor more details, see the page dedicated to ObjectModels\nWeb service (API) The webservice API is another way to retrieve or store data in PrestaShop.\nIt must be enabled from the administration panel before being accessible. See the doc for more details: https://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS17/Webservice\nOnce ready, an API will be available for all the ressources enabled for your key. Basically, the web-service in another interface for object models, themselves interfacing the database.\nYou can use it to retrieve all your products, categories etc from the first shop, and re-inserting them in the other shop without many changes.\nThis option is interesting for people looking for making the process automatic, because:\n the webservice has barely changed since PrestaShop 1.5, you get all the properties of a given object, if a property is multi-lang, you will get the value or a link to another resource for each lang, you can get the images URL of a resource (i.e product), while you can’t find directly from a database column, getting a resource, or inserting one, is done by manipulating XMLs.  Useful links:\n Learning how-to use the webservice API Getting a list of all available ressources, ready for import/export  Migration modules and services Community module Although this solution is not made by PrestaShop, it follows the concept of export / import presented here and has been recommended several time on discussion platforms like the forum.\nThat solution is a module called “MigrationPro” and is available on the Marketplace:\nhttps://addons.prestashop.com/en/data-migration-backup/8934-migrationpro-prestashop-to-prestashop-migration-tool.html\nIt bundles two different modules to install on your old and new shop, respectively responsible of the export and import of the business data. It uses the object models to interact with the database.\nSupport service As well as for the upgrade, you can also ask our support team to proceed with the migration for you.\nYour data will be migrated and your compatible modules will be transferred. As the theme will be lost, you get instead a discount on themes available on the Marketplace. This option is useful for merchants who chose to use an existing theme instead of developing theirs.\nYou can subscribe for this service on the marketplace:\nhttps://addons.prestashop.com/en/support/18689-upgrade-pack-prestashop.html\nMany agencies and freelancers propose this kind of service and some of them are certainly in your area.\n"

	"content": "Keep PrestaShop up-to-date Introduction The purpose of this chapter is to provide the best practices and tips for keeping your PrestaShop up-to-date. Its compatibility range should cover at least shops running on versions 1.6 \u0026amp; 1.7 of PrestaShop.\nKeeping a shop updated to the latest available version ensures you have the latest changes brought by the core team and the developer community. Depending on the version you upgrade to, you can get new features, security or performance improvements, or simply bug fixes.\nFurthermore, the support of PrestaShop 1.6 is now ended. We advise you to use the 1.7 versions to get support, along with core and modules upgrades.\nUpgrade and migration, two different processes Keeping PrestaShop up-to-date can be done via different methods. Choose the best update method depending on your needs.\nIn-place Upgrade Upgrading a shop is the recommended method when you want to get your shop up-to-date without switching to the next major version.\nIt does not require any additional tools to run if you follow the manual process, the most recent release package will be enough.\nImpact on existing data As long as you stay on the same major version (ex. 1.6.0 \u0026raquo; 1.6.1 or 1.7.1 \u0026raquo; 1.7.2 upgrade), we make sure that the available features remain the same. This means that your current theme and all your modules should continue to work as before, and no functionality or data will be lost during the upgrade, even if the database structure may change.\nThis can be explained by the semantic versioning we follow, that forbids any compatibility-breaking change in the core, such as removing a feature or modifying our APIs.\nNote that once an upgrade has started, there is no way to rollback the changes. The only solution you have is restoring the backup you made before.\nProcess summary  Prepare your upgrade by getting the latest release zip file, unpacking it and removing its demo content. Apply the new files by copy-pasting them in the production folder. Run the database upgrade. This could be enough for completing an upgrade, but additional tasks like cleanup and modules upgrade will bring you stability and security.  Migration Upgrading is not the only way to update your shop to the latest version of PrestaShop. In some cases, migrating your data is a better option.\nThis option is recommended when you switch on a new major version. As it brings a lot of changes in the core with many potential incompatibilities with the current theme and modules, starting fresh is less risky for stability.\n“Migrating” means moving your current shop to a new shop which is already running on the latest version in parallel.\nIt implies creating a new shop and transferring your existing data (like products, customers, orders\u0026hellip;) into it, and disable your old shop afterwards.\nThe main advantage of this option is it does not require the shop in production to be in maintenance mode. As long as you feel your new shop is not ready, you can keep the previous one running for your customers.\nImpact on existing data The impact on the existing data is very different from an upgrade, as it depends on what you transfer to the new shop.\nWhen switching to another major version (i.e 1.6.x \u0026raquo; 1.7.x), this will imply that some resources will be lost:\n Permissions  On PrestaShop, the whole permissions system has been reworked to fit with Symfony. We recommend to recreate your employees, access groups and their permissions instead of migrating them.\n Theme  The theme system has been overhauled in 1.7, so 1.6 themes won\u0026rsquo;t work anymore. The controllers have changed, and the data shared between them and the views has also evolved.\n Modules not compatible with the new version  Modules can be more resilient to PrestaShop new releases, but some incompatibilities may occur when using another major version. For modules downloaded from the marketplace, you can check their compatibility range. For home-made modules, contact your developer to check its compatibility, but as a general rule consider them incompatible until proven otherwise.\nEach module reinstalled on the new shop will need to be reconfigured.\nProcess details A migration consists in:\n Setting up a new shop running on the latest version Getting the production content from old shop Modifying the content for compatibility requirements, necessary data update Importing the data in the new shop  Read more  How to backup PrestaShop   How to migrate to PrestaShop 1.7   How to upgrade PrestaShop   How to use the Upgrade Assistant   "

	"content": "Settings Forms Introduction In PrestaShop, there are a lots of settings forms that require a unified way to handle of them. To move the settings creation and update out of controllers the following components are being used:\n Form Data Provider - responsible for options data retrieval and saving the data. Form Handler - responsible for building the form.  Form Data Providers In order to load existing data into the form (when editing, for instance) and save the form data (when the form is submitted), you need to create and register a Form Data Provider.\nYou can create your own based on one of the existing implementations, or on the interface:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form; interface FormDataProviderInterface { /** * @return array the form data as an associative array */ public function getData(); /** * Persists form Data in Database and Filesystem. * * @param array $data * @return array $errors if data can\u0026#39;t persisted an array of errors messages * @throws UndefinedOptionsException */ public function setData(array $data); } The idea is to uncouple data management from Controllers, so populating the form and saving form data will be done in these classes. Be aware though, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t manipulate the database here – that task need to be delegated to dedicated classes.\nForm Handlers Once you are able to manage data loaded to or sent by your forms, you need a way to build those forms (which can be themselves composed of multiple forms).\nFor this, you need a Form Handler. You can either implement it yourself as a class (based on the interface PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\FormHandlerInterface), or use PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s core FormHandler to create a service in a declarative way – no need for a new class!\nAs an example, here\u0026rsquo;s how the Administration page\u0026rsquo;s Form Handler service is declared:\n# /src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/form/form_handler.ymlprestashop.adapter.administration.general.form_handler:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\Handler\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@form.factory\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.hook.dispatcher\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;@prestashop.adapter.administration.general.form_provider\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Form\\Admin\\Configure\\AdvancedParameters\\Administration\\GeneralType\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;AdministrationPageGeneral\u0026#39;- \u0026#39;general\u0026#39; The class PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\Handler has been added in 1.7.8.0.

This is why in modern pages, controllers should be as thin as possible and rely on specific classes (services) to manage the data. As always, check out the existing implementations, like in the PerformanceController.\nThis is how we manage a form submit inside a Controller:\n\u0026lt;?php $form = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.performance.form_handler\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;getForm(); $form-\u0026gt;handleRequest($request); if ($form-\u0026gt;isSubmitted()) { $data = $form-\u0026gt;getData(); $saveErrors = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.performance.form_handler\u0026#39;)-\u0026gt;save($data); if (0 === count($saveErrors)) { $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;success\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Successful update.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Notifications.Success\u0026#39;)); return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_performance\u0026#39;); } $this-\u0026gt;flashErrors($saveErrors); } return $this-\u0026gt;redirectToRoute(\u0026#39;admin_performance\u0026#39;); So, there are basically three steps:\n Get information from User request and get form data; If form has been submitted, validate the form; If form is valid, save it. Else, return form errors and redirect.  Every form in modern controllers must be handled this way, and the controller code should be kept minimalist and easy to read and understand.

It has Product Managers, UX Designers and Wording Managers. Quality Assurance (QA) team: this team takes care of ensuring the quality of the software. It has QA analysts and QA automation engineers. Developers team a.k.a Core Team: this team takes care of the code and act as maintainer for the project.  A maintainer will naturally belong to the Developers team but can also assist and work with the Product Team and QA Team.\nIssues Currently, there are 4 different types of Issues submitted by users on GitHub.\nFeature Request When a user submits a Feature Request, it can be either a Product feature request (example: add a new Back office page) or a Technical feature request (example: support PostgreSQL).\nProduct feature requests are labelled \u0026ldquo;Waiting for PM\u0026rdquo; while Technical feature request are labelled \u0026ldquo;Waiting for dev\u0026rdquo;.\nThe team in charge will then analyse the request and either reject it or accept it. Rejected feature requests are closed while accepted feature requests are added to the roadmap and labelled. Labels will help triaging the backlog.\nBug report When a user submits a bug report, the QA team will analyse it and attempt to reproduce it. If it can be reproduced and is confirmed to be an issue, it will be labelled and added to the roadmap.\nIf it cannot be reproduced, QA team will attempt to explore the issue with the contributor to isolate the very settings responsible for the buggy behavior.\nIf the user does not answer for 30 days or after multiple attempts, it cannot be reproduced on our side, the issue is closed.\nRegressions If the bug report is confirmed, one of the key elements to evaluate is whether it is a regression. A regression is a bug that cannot be observed in the previous PrestaShop version, it means the software quality level has decreased instead of increasing. Regressions are usually milestoned to be fixed in the next patch version.\nThis is not easy The work of analyzing and testing all submitted bug reports is a very complex one, because there might be a very diverse range of reports. Moreover quite a huge number of them are actually not related to the software but to how the shop is being used: the server configuration, the shop configuration, the installed modules and the installed theme might introduce buggy behaviors that the user mistakenly believes come from the software.\nThis is why so much Issues cannot be reproducted on our side, but to find it out multiple explorations and attempts are necessary.\nSupport request We sometimes receive support requests on GitHub, ranging from questions about the software to \u0026ldquo;please help me to do X in my shop\u0026rdquo; requests. GitHub is for the software development so we usually redirect users to other channels using the Support template.\nOther There are some Issues which do not fit in the previous categories, such as releases Issues. They serve a specific purpose.\nPull Requests When a contributor submits a Pull Request, it goes through multiple stages.\nIs it eligible Maintainers must first validate that the Pull Request is eligible to review (the template is filled, the license headers are correct, the target branch is the right one \u0026hellip;).\nIf there is an issue with the Pull Request and it is not eligible, maintainers kindly ask the contributor to fix it.\nAbout the intent If the Pull Request is eligible, maintainers can evaluate if the changes brought by the Pull Request are desirables.\n If the Pull Request brings in changes in design, they can ask the validation of UX designers by adding the label \u0026ldquo;Waiting for UX\u0026rdquo;. If the Pull Request brings in changes to the product, they can ask the validation of Product managers by adding the label \u0026ldquo;Waiting for PM\u0026rdquo;.

For example if Product team validates the new behavior implemented in a Pull Request, they will remove the \u0026ldquo;Waiting for PM\u0026rdquo; label and add the \u0026ldquo;PM approved\u0026rdquo; label instead.\nThere are some automated bots running on GitHub that will help maintainers to label the Pull Requests. For example Prestonbot is able to extract the new wordings and add the \u0026ldquo;Waiting for wording\u0026rdquo; label. You can read more about them here.\nAbout the code If the Pull Request is validated and there are no more \u0026ldquo;Waiting for \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; labels, then it awaits a code review.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Tooling prerequisites for theme designers The way 1.7 themes are created is significantly different from the way they were with PrestaShop 1.6. By taking the freedom to rewrite the way themes work according to the latest best-practices, we chose to also work with modern tools. These tools are widely accepted as best-of-breed in the current web development; hence, learning to use them will not only make you more productive in PrestaShop development, but more importantly in web development in general.\nWhile those tools will help all designers and developers in the long run, there is a first step of knowing how to use them, particularly if you have never used such a chain of tools through the command line.\nThis page is here to help! It will browse through the toolset, so that you know what the rest of the documentation is talking about :)\nWhich tools are we talking about? The PrestaShop developers chose to rely on these tools for the development of the Classic theme:\n Git Composer npm Webpack  Along with these tools, PrestaShop 1.7 introduces frameworks and design tools that are must-know:\n Bootstrap 4 Symfony and its Twig template engine Sass Bourbon  This document presents each tool, and how they can get you to become a more productive web developer \u0026ndash; not just a more productive PrestaShop theme developer!\nBefore we get started: using the command line Many of the tools cited above are to be used through the command line \u0026ndash; launching commands in a text-based environment, line after line. While it has the advantage of being very powerful and easy to automate, it is also not intuitive and can be hard to grasp. Luckily, it only take a handful of commands to understand the power of the command line, and to adopt it for your everyday processes.\nNow, as a web-designer, you might be more used to work with graphical interfaces, such as Dreamweaver (for the more WYSIWYG-inclined), or a full-featured text editor, such as Sublime Text, Atom or Brackets (among many other possibilities). Using the command line can supplement this.\nAll operating systems give you access to a command line interface (CLI).\n  Windows: It is called the \u0026ldquo;command prompt\u0026rdquo;.\n  You can open it this way:\n Open the Start menu, for instance by pressing the Windows key of your keyboard. In the Search field, type cmd and press Enter. This will start the cmd.exe program.    Try out a few basic commands:\n dir: lists the files in the current folder. cd: change the current directory. For instance, \u0026ldquo;cd Downloads\u0026rdquo; to enter a Downloads directory in the current folder; or cd .. to go to the parent folder. ping: to see the response time for a website. For instance, ping google.com.    Note: Windows 10 also includes the Linux-\n    OS X: It is called the \u0026ldquo;terminal\u0026rdquo;.\n  You can open it this way:\n Open Spotlight, for instance by pressing the Command key and Spacebar at the same time. In the Search field, start typing \u0026ldquo;terminal\u0026rdquo; until the real \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; is suggested, then press Enter. This will start the Terminal.app program.    Try out a few basic commands:\n ls: displays the content of the current folder. cd: change the current directory. For instance, cd Downloads to enter a Downloads directory in the current folder; or cd .. to go to the parent folder. ping: to see the response time for a website. For instance, ping google.com.      Unix/Linux: Oh come on, don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you don\u0026rsquo;t already use bash, tcsh, zsh or any other POSIX variation of the concept! :)\n  There are many default tools and commands which you can use and even combine, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to use some non-standards tools: npm, Git, Composer and Webpack. Because they are non-standards, you will have to install and configure them first.\nNote that you do not HAVE TO use these exactly: you can choose alternatives such as Gulp or Grunt if you\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with them. We simply use Webpack :)\nUsing Git to manage your project files Git is a version control system, designed to manage decentralized projects with speed and efficiency. In plain English: you can use Git to save the current state of your files (through individual snapshot), in order to return to a previous state should the need arise, among other things.\nAs a theme designer, tracking all your CSS and JavaScript changes can help you return to a previous snapshot of a file or of the whole project, add new code without breaking the code that\u0026rsquo;s already working, collaborate with others, and in general keep you from losing your project because of a bad Ctrl-S.\nIf you have already used the Subversion system, think of Git as a decentralized Subversion (to keep it simple): any machine hosts all versions of all the files, and therefore there is no centralized repository. In effect, the PrestaShop project is mainly hosted on GitHub \u0026ndash; but developers also work on it on their own machine.\nWhy you should use it for your PrestaShop theme? The PrestaShop Open Source project makes heavy use of Git in order to keep versions of its files. The community can access the official public repository on GitHub: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop\nAs a theme designer, you will need Git in order to retrieve the latest version of PrestaShop 1.7 and its default theme, \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo;.\nNote: You do not need to install or use Git if you are not interested in the latest development of PrestaShop.\nHow can you install it? Simply download the archive for the latest version of Git (2.23 as of this writing) and install it just like you would do for any other software:\n  Windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io/\n User interfaces are available, for instance https://tortoisegit.org/ or https://www.gitkraken.com/    OS X: https://git-scm.com/download/mac\n User interfaces are available, for instance https://git-fork.com/ or https://www.gitkraken.com/    Linux: type apt-get install git (or your distribution\u0026rsquo;s equivalent).\n  You can then open your command line and type git --version to check that Git is indeed installed. It should display the version number. You\u0026rsquo;re good to go!\nUsing Composer to manage your PHP dependencies The PHP ecosystem is made of code packages which can be embedded into bigger projects, or even into other code packages which, in turn, can be embedded, etc. These packages are called dependencies.\nBeing able to rely on such code packages is great, because it prevents from having to reinvent the wheel every time a well-known feature is needed. On the other hand, dependencies can get problematic: the more a project depends on third-party package, the more it must manage dependency resolution (determining which package to use), autoloading solution (finding the right package and making it available automatically), and keeping all packages up to date (or not, if backward compatibility is an issue).\nIn short, the modern PHP ecosystem can get complex quite quickly, and Composer is the main way PHP developers manage their dependencies.\nWhy you should use it for your PrestaShop theme? Now, why should you care about PHP files when working on a PrestaShop theme? Since you mostly work with theme files (.tpl, .css and .js), .php files are few in your editor, and \u0026ldquo;PHP dependencies\u0026rdquo; is something out there, and it seems you\u0026rsquo;d be better off avoiding them, right?\nThing is, PrestaShop uses Composer to build its own package dependencies. While the Zip archive available for public download is packed with all the required dependencies, the Git-hosted files do not automatically download and install all those dependencies: PrestaShop developers rely on Composer for that, through a composer.json file located at the root of the official Git folder.\nIn short, you need to use Composer when working with the latest development version from Github, in order to have a complete set of packages.\nYes, that means that if you choose not to retrieve the latest PrestaShop files using Git, but to simply install the latest public archive, then you do not need to worry about Composer. But not using the latest Git version also means that you cannot work with the development version of PrestaShop, and that you rely on the Core developers to release upgraded packages, thus giving you no head start in developing with new features. Your call!\nHow can you install it? Download the archive for the latest version of Composer (1.9 as of this writing) and install it just like you would do for any other software:\nNote: you need to already have the PHP tool installed on your machine. You probably already have it if you\u0026rsquo;re building websites locally. If not, install WampServer, EasyPHP, XAMPP or any other Windows Apache+PHP+MySQL package there is.\n  Windows: https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe\n  OS X and Linux: in your command line, type these commands:\n curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer    Testing it requires using the command line; there is no graphical interface for this tool. Simply type composer --version to check that it is indeed installed.\nUsing npm to automate compilation from third-party package npm is a popular package manager, which originates from the JavaScript ecosystem \u0026ndash; most precisely, from the Node.js JS runtime environment.\nnpm is both a command line tool and an online registry (located at https://www.npmjs.com/): you can use it to manage the dependencies (yes, just like Composer), or simply to work with useful packages. It is an extremely useful command to have when building websites, even if you do not use JavaScript or Node.js.\nWhy you should use it for your PrestaShop theme? In the context of building PrestaShop themes, npm is mostly used in order to automate tasks \u0026ndash; namely, building assets automatically so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nPrestaShop 1.7 themes are built around \u0026ldquo;assets\u0026rdquo;: CSS, JavaScript and image files, which are (or can be) generated from easier-to-manager formats:\n CSS files are built from Sass files (.scss). Some image files are built from SVG files (.svg). JavaScript files are from several files (.js).  All the source files are located in the theme\u0026rsquo;s _dev folder. The generated files are built using Webpack, a JavaScript module bundler. See below for more information about Webpack.\nHow can you install it? npm cannot be directly downloaded and installed. It is an integral part of the Node.js tool, therefore you need to download and install Node.js, which in turn will install npm for you.\nTo download Node.js, head to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and choose the LTS version for your platform. LTS means Long Term Support (currently, 10.16.3): this version contains less features than the Current version (currently, v12.11.1), but is very stable and will be supported until April 2021.\nSo, install Node.js on your machine, then test that npm is available:\n Open your command line interface. Type node -v to check that Node.js is installed. Type npm -v to check that npm is indeed available.  npm is updated much more frequently that Node.js, so chances are that there\u0026rsquo;s a more recent version available than the one from the Node.js package.\nTo update your npm:\n Open your command line interface. Type npm install npm -g: this tells npm to install npm as global package. Type npm -v to check if the version has indeed changed.  Using Webpack to compile and minify your asset files Modern website are getting more and more complex, and JavaScript becomes more prominent than ever in the web-development world. As a result there is a lot of code on the client side!\nWebpack was built in order to make your life easier, most notably by organizing your code into JavaScript modules. It takes a whole lot of work off your shoulders: you have better things to do than to edit configuration files in order to adjust media files, fonts or URLs.\nBefore Webpack, many were using task-runners such as Grunt or Gulp in order to organize their code. That lead to a patchwork of configuration, and you had to pay a lot of attention to any change in order to not break everything. Webpack fixes this in an elegant way.\nWhy you should use it for your PrestaShop theme? Let’s see where we’re at. So far was have installed:\n Git: A better way to make a snapshot of your codebase. Composer: A better way to manage your PHP dependencies. npm: A better way to automate tasks (among many other things).  It’s all fine and dandy, but all of this remains very developer-centric, and there comes a time when you have to think about the user, and optimize for the browser. Fear not, for Webpack is here to save the day! Webpack is a “module bundler”, meaning that it turns your assets into JavaScript modules, and packs them into static assets.\nSo, the main interest of using Webpack is that it will compile all your styles into a single CSS file. This way, your theme will make only one HTTP request for this single file, and since your browser will cache it for later re-use, it will even download this file only once.\nThe same goes for your JavaScript code. Instead of loading jQuery along with its community plugins, your own custom plugins and any extra code you might need, Webpack compiles and minifies all this JavaScript code into a single file, which will be loaded once - and cached.\nHow can you install it? From the moment you have npm installed (see above), Webpack can be installed in a few seconds:\n Open your command line interface. Type npm install webpack -g  "

	"content": "Tooling prerequisites for theme designers The way 1.7 themes are created is significantly different from the way they were with PrestaShop 1.6. By taking the freedom to rewrite the way themes work according to the latest best-practices, we chose to also work with modern tools. These tools are widely accepted as best-of-breed in the current web development; hence, learning to use them will not only make you more productive in PrestaShop development, but more importantly in web development in general.\nWhile those tools will help all designers and developers in the long run, there is a first step of knowing how to use them, particularly if you have never used such a chain of tools through the command line.\nThis page is here to help! It will browse through the toolset, so that you know what the rest of the documentation is talking about :)\nWhich tools are we talking about? The PrestaShop developers chose to rely on these tools for the development of the Classic theme:\n Git Composer npm Webpack  Along with these tools, PrestaShop 1.7 introduces frameworks and design tools that are must-know:\n Bootstrap 4 Symfony and its Twig template engine Sass Bourbon  This document presents each tool, and how they can get you to become a more productive web developer \u0026ndash; not just a more productive PrestaShop theme developer!\nBefore we get started: using the command line Many of the tools cited above are to be used through the command line \u0026ndash; launching commands in a text-based environment, line after line. While it has the advantage of being very powerful and easy to automate, it is also not intuitive and can be hard to grasp. Luckily, it only take a handful of commands to understand the power of the command line, and to adopt it for your everyday processes.\nNow, as a web-designer, you might be more used to work with graphical interfaces, such as Dreamweaver (for the more WYSIWYG-inclined), or a full-featured text editor, such as Sublime Text, Atom or Brackets (among many other possibilities). Using the command line can supplement this.\nAll operating systems give you access to a command line interface (CLI).\n  Windows: It is called the \u0026ldquo;command prompt\u0026rdquo;.\n  You can open it this way:\n Open the Start menu, for instance by pressing the Windows key of your keyboard. In the Search field, type cmd and press Enter. This will start the cmd.exe program.    Try out a few basic commands:\n dir: lists the files in the current folder. cd: change the current directory. For instance, \u0026ldquo;cd Downloads\u0026rdquo; to enter a Downloads directory in the current folder; or cd .. to go to the parent folder. ping: to see the response time for a website. For instance, ping google.com.    Note: Windows 10 also includes the Linux-\n    OS X: It is called the \u0026ldquo;terminal\u0026rdquo;.\n  You can open it this way:\n Open Spotlight, for instance by pressing the Command key and Spacebar at the same time. In the Search field, start typing \u0026ldquo;terminal\u0026rdquo; until the real \u0026ldquo;Terminal\u0026rdquo; is suggested, then press Enter. This will start the Terminal.app program.    Try out a few basic commands:\n ls: displays the content of the current folder. cd: change the current directory. For instance, cd Downloads to enter a Downloads directory in the current folder; or cd .. to go to the parent folder. ping: to see the response time for a website. For instance, ping google.com.      Unix/Linux: Oh come on, don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you don\u0026rsquo;t already use bash, tcsh, zsh or any other POSIX variation of the concept! :)\n  There are many default tools and commands which you can use and even combine, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to use some non-standards tools: npm, Git, Composer and Webpack. Because they are non-standards, you will have to install and configure them first.\nNote that you do not HAVE TO use these exactly: you can choose alternatives such as Gulp or Grunt if you\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with them. We simply use Webpack :)\nUsing Git to manage your project files Git is a version control system, designed to manage decentralized projects with speed and efficiency. In plain English: you can use Git to save the current state of your files (through individual snapshot), in order to return to a previous state should the need arise, among other things.\nAs a theme designer, tracking all your CSS and JavaScript changes can help you return to a previous snapshot of a file or of the whole project, add new code without breaking the code that\u0026rsquo;s already working, collaborate with others, and in general keep you from losing your project because of a bad Ctrl-S.\nIf you have already used the Subversion system, think of Git as a decentralized Subversion (to keep it simple): any machine hosts all versions of all the files, and therefore there is no centralized repository. In effect, the PrestaShop project is mainly hosted on GitHub \u0026ndash; but developers also work on it on their own machine.\nWhy you should use it for your PrestaShop theme? The PrestaShop Open Source project makes heavy use of Git in order to keep versions of its files.

	"content": "Translation Domains Sometimes wordings may seem vague when seen out of context. For example, \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo;. Just like that, we can imagine what is it used for, but we don\u0026rsquo;t really have much information about it. What are we deleting? From a translator standpoint, this is very hard, because not only do we not know where it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be used, but it could be used in several places, with different meanings.\nDepending on the language, it will be more or less easy to translate it just vaguely enough so that the phrase makes sense in every one of those different contexts.\nTranslation Domains bring an answer to this problem. By allowing to separate wordings in contextual groups, if the same wording appears in more than one domain, then it can be have a different translation in each one of them. This way, translators are better able to adapt the meaning of each wording to the specific context in which they appear.\nThis feature was originally described in this blog post and has been updated here. Understanding the Domains' structure Domains have been organized in 5 major sections: Shop, Admin, Modules, Email and Install. All the PrestaShop translatable strings are spread across these 5 domains, according to the following definition:\n   Domain Description     Admin Back office and content aimed at merchants   Email Emails sent from the shop   Install Content from the installation wizard   Modules Native modules   Shop Default theme, front office and content aimed at customers    These are called \u0026ldquo;first-level\u0026rdquo; domains. Domains are further broken down in at least two and up to three levels or \u0026ldquo;subdomains\u0026rdquo;, for example:\nShop.Theme.Checkout There are two exceptions to this rule: Installer and messages have only one level. The latter contains all wordings that did not have any domain assigned at the time of release of 1.7.0 and thus have been kept for backwards compatibility.\nIn the end a domain like Shop.Theme.Checkout corresponds to a specific folder in Crowdin, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all the strings from the default theme, related to the checkout process (funnel, shopping cart, etc.).\nDomains are stored as XLIFF files in PrestaShop, with one file per subdomain. See the full list here. Read below for more details on how we organized domains and what they contain.\nInstall This is the easiest one, there\u0026rsquo;s only one domain: Install. It\u0026rsquo;s the content from the installation wizard.\nModules For modules, it\u0026rsquo;s rather simple. We still have a \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; folder (first-level), which contains either a file or folder for each module: this the second level. The third level is here to say whether the string appears in the front office (Shop) or the back office (Admin).\nShop For the front office, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit more complex. Any string related to the front office goes into the Shop domain. That\u0026rsquo;s the first level. Then it\u0026rsquo;s split in various sections, mostly functional. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works for the second level:\n   Domain Strings     Emails The emails sent from the shop to a customer (order confirmation, account creation, etc.)   PDF The PDFs sent to a customer (invoice, delivery slip, credit slip, etc.)   Theme The strings attached to the default theme \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo;.   Demo The content from the demo products and demo pages (\u0026ldquo;About us\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Terms and conditions of use\u0026rdquo;, etc.). If you remove the de content, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need any of these strings.   Navigation Most of the meta titles and page names from the default theme.   Notifications The warning, error or success messages that can appear in the shop.   Forms The forms available in the shop (\u0026ldquo;Contact us\u0026rdquo; page, addresses, etc.)    Each of this domain can be further divided to provide even more context.\nShop.Theme    Domain Strings     Catalog All the strings needed to display your catalog (product page, categories, etc.).   Customer Account Anything related to the management of a customer account and the orders.   Checkout Everything related to the act of buying - i.e. if you\u0026rsquo;re in catalog mode, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need these strings.   Actions All the call-to-actions, buttons or links that you find on the shop and that aren\u0026rsquo;t specific to a page or context.    Shop.Demo    Domain Strings     Catalog Content for demo product and categories (descriptions).   Pages Content inside the demo pages (formerly known as CMS pages).    Shop.Notifications Notifications are split according to their level of alert: Info, Error, Warning or Success. They are the messages showing up on your shop.\nShop.Forms    Domain Strings     Labels The form labels   Errors Its corresponding errors (distinct from the theme errors, these one are specific to the form and will display inline)   Help Hints to help users fill in the form (special characters, etc.).    Admin Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how things are organized for the strings from the back office.\n   Domain Strings     Actions All the call-to-actions, buttons or links that you find on the back office, and that are quite generic (\u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Add \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo;, etc.). Again, if it applies to one page and one functional domain only, then this is not the domain to use.   Advanced Parameters Content from the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Settings\u0026rdquo; section. Note the lower case \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Advparameters   Catalog Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Catalog\u0026rdquo; section.   Dashboard Strings from the Dashboard page.   Design Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Design\u0026rdquo; section.   Global Anything which doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall in the below categories, but is still related to the back office, that can be found in a lot occurrences (\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Enabled\u0026rdquo;, etc.) AND in different parts of the software too. If a string is specific to a given page, then it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in the global domain.   International Strings form the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; section.   Login Strings from the Login screen.   Modules Strings from the Modules page.   Navigation The structure shared by all pages of the back office.   Notifications All the warning, error or success messages that can appear in the back office.They must be general notification applying to any part of the software (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Settings updated\u0026rdquo;). In case you have a specific notification (\u0026ldquo;Friendly URLs are currently disabled\u0026rdquo;), then it should fall under the notification subdomain for its functional domain (here Admin.Catalog.Notification).   Orders \u0026amp; Customers Strings for the \u0026ldquo;Orders\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Customers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Customer Service\u0026rdquo; sections from the back office. Note the lower case \u0026ldquo;c\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Orderscustomers.   Payment Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Payment\u0026rdquo; section.   Shipping Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Shipping\u0026rdquo; section.   Shop Parameters Content from the \u0026ldquo;Shop Parameters\u0026rdquo; section. Note the lower case \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Shopparameters.   Stats Content from the \u0026ldquo;Stats\u0026rdquo; section.    "

Domains are further broken down in at least two and up to three levels or \u0026ldquo;subdomains\u0026rdquo;, for example:\nShop.Theme.Checkout There are two exceptions to this rule: Installer and messages have only one level. The latter contains all wordings that did not have any domain assigned at the time of release of 1.7.0 and thus have been kept for backwards compatibility.\nIn the end a domain like Shop.Theme.Checkout corresponds to a specific folder in Crowdin, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all the strings from the default theme, related to the checkout process (funnel, shopping cart, etc.).\nDomains are stored as XLIFF files in PrestaShop, with one file per subdomain. See the full list here. Read below for more details on how we organized domains and what they contain.\nInstall This is the easiest one, there\u0026rsquo;s only one domain: Install. It\u0026rsquo;s the content from the installation wizard.\nModules For modules, it\u0026rsquo;s rather simple. We still have a \u0026ldquo;Modules\u0026rdquo; folder (first-level), which contains either a file or folder for each module: this the second level. The third level is here to say whether the string appears in the front office (Shop) or the back office (Admin).\nShop For the front office, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit more complex. Any string related to the front office goes into the Shop domain. That\u0026rsquo;s the first level. Then it\u0026rsquo;s split in various sections, mostly functional. Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works for the second level:\n   Domain Strings     Emails The emails sent from the shop to a customer (order confirmation, account creation, etc.)   PDF The PDFs sent to a customer (invoice, delivery slip, credit slip, etc.)   Theme The strings attached to the default theme \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo;.   Demo The content from the demo products and demo pages (\u0026ldquo;About us\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Terms and conditions of use\u0026rdquo;, etc.). If you remove the de content, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need any of these strings.   Navigation Most of the meta titles and page names from the default theme.   Notifications The warning, error or success messages that can appear in the shop.   Forms The forms available in the shop (\u0026ldquo;Contact us\u0026rdquo; page, addresses, etc.)    Each of this domain can be further divided to provide even more context.\nShop.Theme    Domain Strings     Catalog All the strings needed to display your catalog (product page, categories, etc.).   Customer Account Anything related to the management of a customer account and the orders.   Checkout Everything related to the act of buying - i.e. if you\u0026rsquo;re in catalog mode, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need these strings.   Actions All the call-to-actions, buttons or links that you find on the shop and that aren\u0026rsquo;t specific to a page or context.    Shop.Demo    Domain Strings     Catalog Content for demo product and categories (descriptions).   Pages Content inside the demo pages (formerly known as CMS pages).    Shop.Notifications Notifications are split according to their level of alert: Info, Error, Warning or Success. They are the messages showing up on your shop.\nShop.Forms    Domain Strings     Labels The form labels   Errors Its corresponding errors (distinct from the theme errors, these one are specific to the form and will display inline)   Help Hints to help users fill in the form (special characters, etc.).    Admin Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how things are organized for the strings from the back office.\n   Domain Strings     Actions All the call-to-actions, buttons or links that you find on the back office, and that are quite generic (\u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Add \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo;, etc.). Again, if it applies to one page and one functional domain only, then this is not the domain to use.   Advanced Parameters Content from the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Settings\u0026rdquo; section. Note the lower case \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Advparameters   Catalog Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Catalog\u0026rdquo; section.   Dashboard Strings from the Dashboard page.   Design Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Design\u0026rdquo; section.   Global Anything which doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall in the below categories, but is still related to the back office, that can be found in a lot occurrences (\u0026ldquo;Max\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Enabled\u0026rdquo;, etc.) AND in different parts of the software too. If a string is specific to a given page, then it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in the global domain.   International Strings form the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; section.   Login Strings from the Login screen.   Modules Strings from the Modules page.   Navigation The structure shared by all pages of the back office.   Notifications All the warning, error or success messages that can appear in the back office.They must be general notification applying to any part of the software (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Settings updated\u0026rdquo;). In case you have a specific notification (\u0026ldquo;Friendly URLs are currently disabled\u0026rdquo;), then it should fall under the notification subdomain for its functional domain (here Admin.Catalog.Notification).   Orders \u0026amp; Customers Strings for the \u0026ldquo;Orders\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Customers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Customer Service\u0026rdquo; sections from the back office. Note the lower case \u0026ldquo;c\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Orderscustomers.   Payment Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Payment\u0026rdquo; section.   Shipping Strings from the \u0026ldquo;Shipping\u0026rdquo; section.   Shop Parameters Content from the \u0026ldquo;Shop Parameters\u0026rdquo; section. Note the lower case \u0026ldquo;p\u0026rdquo; in Admin.Shopparameters.   Stats Content from the \u0026ldquo;Stats\u0026rdquo; section.    "

	"content": "Upgrade module internal behavior This is how the module is built, for version 4 and higher.\nMost of the information is however valid with the previous versions too.\nEntrypoints The upgrade module aims to be a PrestaShop module AND be as independent as possible. Which means its content can be reached from several way:\n autoupgrade.php  Every module developer will recognize its content. This file is used to manage the module part of the project: installation, uninstallation, then automatic redirection to the next file.\n AdminSelfUpgrade.php  This controller uses the AdminController features from PrestaShop. It allows the upgrade configuration to be displayed in the back office. The merchant will see the configuration options.\nIn previous versions it was used to handle everything, displaying answers, handle and dispatching requests\u0026hellip; In the latest version, its responsibilities were restricted, which should be displaying the configuration page.\n ajax-upgradetab.php  This file is called from ajax requests. This is the only file responsible of the initialization and upgrade / rollback steps. This file is not a PrestaShop controller for a simple but important reason, we do not want to rely on the core during an upgrade or a rollback, this would increase the risk of crashes.\n cli-upgrade.php  This is the equivalent of ajax-upgradetab.php file for CLI calls. It will instantiate some specific features to the CLI, like a logger displaying informations on the fly. This entrypoint is also useful for testing, or for a user who does not want to use the web version.\nWhat version to use The objective is to have a single module version to handle these PrestaShop upgrades:\n 1.6 \u0026raquo; to \u0026raquo; 1.6 / 1.7 1.7 \u0026raquo; to \u0026raquo; 1.7  The other versions are not supported anymore. We recommend to use the previous versions of the module available on the PrestaShop marketplace.\nTechnical choices Compatibility with PrestaShop 1.6 \u0026amp; 1.7 Aim is to help as many merchants as possible to upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7. This required to do the following implementation choices:\n Twig as template engine  Even if Smarty is still provided by the core, it was decided to use an independant engine template.\nThis makes sure than replacing the core template engine won\u0026rsquo;t break the module later.\n Core classes avoided  Dependencies between the core and the module are limited, because the upgrade will modify classes the modules might need, it is important to avoid relying on them.\nA 100% independent module would be great, but because some features absolutely need the core, it is not achievable. So it was tried to avoiding, when possible, using the core logic. This is mainly until the UpgradeDb step, in order to avoid some undefined methods coming from the new files.\n Separate requests  The best compromise was to separate requests (even the CLI one) in several steps.\nBy doing so, a new fresh core can be started with its updated classes.\nThe class Upgrade was introduced to the core around version 1.7.1.0.\n Interface still unfriendly  So far the main objective has been to make the PHP code easier to understand and improve the robustness of the upgrade process where possible. The interface will be improved in future releases to be more user-friendly.\nNew module structure Most of the PHP classes in classes folder are mainly logic extracted from AdminSelfUpgrade, the class that was responsible of everything in previous versions. It has been splitted in smaller parts.\nClasses are gathered by responsibilities:\n All classes responsible of the display (Twig related) Classes used for the module to work Classes interacting with PrestaShop core Tasks (Can be considered as controllers for upgrade, rollback etc.)  Local temporary assets In order to work properly, the upgrade module needs to write some files to your filesystem server. These files are stored in the following folders, all available in the \u0026lt;admin folder\u0026gt;/autoupgrade path.\nFolders  backup: Folder in which the current state of the shop will be saved before upgrade. It contains files archive, DB structure \u0026amp; data. download: Destination folder of the downloaded PrestaShop archive, before unzip. latest: Working directory of the autoupgrade.

	"content": "Value Objects PrestaShop is using Value Objects in its codebase. To help you understand better what they are, this article aims to explain what Value object is and how to use it.\nWhat is Value Object? Value Objects (VO for short) are small, simple, immutable objects, like Money or a date range, whose equality is not based on their identity. This means that any two given instances of a same VO are considered equal when they contain the same values.\nValue Objects are often referred to as Value Types as well. You can consider a Value Object like a data type, whose objective is to provide structure, validation, and meaning.\nCharacteristics of Value Object are:\n It does not have an identity, contrary to an Entity (e.g. Money($amount) can be considered a VO because two instances of it can be considered equal as long as the $amount is equal, regardless of which bills that amount is made of; but Bill($billNumber) is an entity because it refers to a specific physical Bill). It is immutable (e.g. it cannot be modified; any modification on it yields a different instance). It is self validating (e.g. value object cannot be created with invalid values, meaning that attempt to create new Email('not an email') would throw an exception). It is interchangeable (e.g. $a and $b can replace one another without any side effects if they both are created like $a = new Money(100) and $b = new Money(100)).  Examples of Value Objects in PrestaShop As an example, we can take a look at PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Currency\\ValueObject\\ExchangeRate value object. ExchangeRate is used to pass currency exchange rate between different parts of system.\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Currency\\ValueObject\\ExchangeRate; // ExchangeRate has VO has rules to protect. // In this case, ExchangeRate validates that it\u0026#39;s value cannot be 0 or less. // If we were to create ExchangeRate with value of -1, // then CurrencyConstraintException would be thrown.  $exchangeRate = new ExchangeRate(-1); // throws exception, because exhange rate value is not within boundaries  // However, if ExchangeRate value is within allowed boundaries, // then it will successfully produce us new instance of ExchangeRate.  $exhangeRate = new ExchangeRate(1.25); // this would work, since 1.25 is a valid exhange rate value Another good side effect of using value objects in your code is that it helps you avoid unnesecery assertions.\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Currency\\ValueObject\\ExchangeRate; class MyService { // ...  public function calculate(ExchangeRate $rate) { // you don\u0026#39;t need to make additional assertions here (e.g. null !== $rate)  // since you can trust that ExchangeRate contains valid value  // as it was created somewhere in the system.  // ... do some calculation with $rate  } } "

	"content": "Configuring PrestaShop By default, PrestaShop is configured to provide a secure and stable environment to both the shop administrator and the customers.\nAs a developer, there are several changes that you could and should bring to the default installation in order to help you code better, spot bugs faster, and generally make a great PrestaShop product.\nDisabling the cache and forcing Smarty compilation When your development has an impact on the front office, whether you are building a theme or simply a module which displays information to the customer, you should force the template file compilation and disable the cache, so as to always see the result of your changes directly.\nGo to the “Performance” page under the “Advanced parameters” menu to change the following Smarty settings:\n Template cache: switch it to “Force compilation”. Cache: disable it.  Forcing the compilation of Smarty will always slow down the loading time of the page. Make sure that your production store is set to only recompile templates if there are updated files, and that its cache is enabled.\nDisplaying error messages PrestaShop’s default settings prevent the customer to see any server error message or any debugging code.\nYou, on the other hand, need this information in order to correct any potential mistake in your code. To that end, open the /config/defines.inc.php file, and edit it to set _PS_MODE_DEV_ to true:\n\u0026lt;?php /* Debug only */ define(\u0026#39;_PS_MODE_DEV_\u0026#39;, true); You can also enable developer mode directly from your back-office, go to the “Performance” page under the “Advanced parameters” menu and change the following setting: \u0026ldquo;Debug mode\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to disable developer mode as soon as you have finished debugging your code.\nUsing the dump() function PrestaShop used to have custom debug functions available for developers: p($variable) and d($variable). They were used to display the content of a variable, and were really a wrapper around the well-known print_r() method. On top of that, PrestaShop had the ppp() and ddd() functions, which were respectively the aliases of p() and d(); and the various fd(), epr() and dieObject() functions.\nAll of this has changed with PrestaShop 1.7: we now rely solely on Symfony VarDumper\u0026rsquo;s dump() function. You can now rely on a single function instead of having multiple debug functions. The dump() function is very powerful, and is always available on output (even without die()). Moreover, you can use it in your console scripts because this function also has a formatter in CLI mode.\nThe dump() function is not activated by default. To activate it, you must enable the Debug mode, by setting _PS_MODE_DEV_ to true (see above).\nEnabling the multistore mode Since version 1.5, PrestaShop is able to host more than one store within a single installation of the software. Many shop administrators choose to enable this feature, and it can have a significant impact on the way PrestaShop works. You should therefore make sure that anything you code for PrestaShop works in both single and multistore mode.\nEnabling the multistore mode is easy: go to the general preferences page, and put the “Enable Multistore” option to “Yes”.\nYou can switch back and forth between single store and multistore mode. In single store mode, only the main store is used.\nYou can read more about the multistore mode in PrestaShop 1.7 User Guide.\nAbout the configuration files There are four main configuration files, three located in the /config folder:\n config.inc.php defines.inc.php smarty.config.inc.php  and one located in the /app/config folder:\n parameters.php  config.inc.php It is the main configuration file for PrestaShop. You should not have to touch anything in there.\ndefines.inc.php This file contains PrestaShop constant values.\nIt also contains the location of all the files and folders. If you need to change their location, do not forget to keep the original path nearby, for instance in a PHP comment, in case you need to revert back to it later on.\nWhen in development/test mode, you must make sure that all the error messages are displayed:\n Set define('_PS_MODE_DEV_', false); to true.  On the contrary, when in production mode, you must hide error messages as much as possible!\n Make sure that define('_PS_MODE_DEV_', false); is set to false.  You can override constant values from this file by setting them in /config/defines_custom.inc.php. This is also a great place to put your custom constants which needs to be available globally in the system.\nsmarty.config.inc.php This file contains all the Smarty-related settings.\nThe Smarty cache system should always be disabled, as it is not compatible with PrestaShop: keep $smarty-\u0026gt;caching = false; as it is.\n$smarty-\u0026gt;compile_check should be left to false in development mode.\n$smarty-\u0026gt;debugging gives access to Smarty debug information when displaying a page. That setting is more easily modified in the “Performance” page of the advanced parameters menu : the “Debug console” option enables you to choose between never displaying Smarty’s debug information, always displaying it, or only displaying it when you add ?SMARTY_DEBUG to the URL of the page you want to test, which can be very useful.\nWhen in production mode, $smarty-\u0026gt;force_compile must be set to false, as it will give a 30% boost to your page load time.\nOn the other hand, when editing a .tpl file, you must delete the /var/cache/(dev|prod)/smarty/compile folder (except the index.php file) in order to see your changes applied or clear cache directly from Back-Office.\nNote that this setting can be made directly from the back office, in the “Performance” page under the “Advanced parameters” menu.\nparameters.php This file contains some of important settings such as database connection details and caching mechanism. If you change something in this file, make sure to delete cache files manually from /var/cache/(dev|prod) folder.\nDisable the Back-Office token protection Back-Office pages require the use of a token. If needed, this protection can be disabled using an environment variable:\nApache with mod_headers SetEnv _TOKEN_ disabled Nginx with ngx_http_headers_module add_header _TOKEN_ disabled; "

Usage examples Using Commands In this example, we will be working with edition in a Contact CRUD Form.\nTo get started, let\u0026rsquo;s inject the CommandBus into our Form Data Handler.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_data_handler.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_handler.contact_form_data_handler:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler\\ContactFormDataHandler\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.command_bus\u0026#39;and in ContactFormDataHandler:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\CommandBus\\CommandBusInterface; final class ContactFormDataHandler implements FormDataHandlerInterface { /** * @var CommandBusInterface */ private $commandBus; /** * @param CommandBusInterface $commandBus */ public function __construct(CommandBusInterface $commandBus) { $this-\u0026gt;commandBus = $commandBus; } } Right now the first step is completed – the Command Bus is injected in the Form Data Handler. Let\u0026rsquo;s use it!\nInstead of modifying the entity object directly in the Form Data Handler\u0026rsquo;s update() method, we can delegate that task to a Command. All we have to do is create an instance of that command using the form\u0026rsquo;s $data and then dispatch it using the CommandBus.\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataHandler; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\CommandBus\\CommandBusInterface; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Contact\\Command\\EditContactCommand; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Contact\\Exception\\ContactException; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Contact\\ValueObject\\ContactId; final class ContactFormDataHandler implements FormDataHandlerInterface { /** * @var CommandBusInterface */ private $commandBus; /** * @param CommandBusInterface $commandBus */ public function __construct(CommandBusInterface $commandBus) { $this-\u0026gt;commandBus = $commandBus; } /** * {@inheritdoc} * * @throws ContactException */ public function update($id, array $data) { $editContactCommand = (new EditContactCommand((int) $id)) -\u0026gt;setLocalisedTitles($data[\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;]) -\u0026gt;setEmail($data[\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;]) -\u0026gt;setIsMessagesSavingEnabled($data[\u0026#39;is_messages_saving_enabled\u0026#39;]) -\u0026gt;setLocalisedDescription($data[\u0026#39;description\u0026#39;]) -\u0026gt;setShopAssociation(is_array($data[\u0026#39;shop_association\u0026#39;]) ? $data[\u0026#39;shop_association\u0026#39;] : []) ; $this-\u0026gt;commandBus-\u0026gt;handle($editContactCommand); } } In the update() method, EditContactCommand is used to encapsulate the actual action of saving the form. After that, the Command Bus handles the given command (persisting the information).\nRetrieving the created object ID As a general rule, Commands Handlers return nothing. However, when creating a new object, the created object ID is usually determined by the database engine. How do we handle that?\nIn this specific case, we allow Command Handlers to return the id of the newly created object after it\u0026rsquo;s inserted into the database:\n\u0026lt;?php public function create(array $data) { $addContactCommand = new AddContactCommand( $data[\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;], $data[\u0026#39;is_messages_saving_enabled\u0026#39;] ); $contactId = $this-\u0026gt;commandBus-\u0026gt;handle($addContactCommand); return $contactId-\u0026gt;getValue(); } In this example, the Command Handler for AddContactCommand returns a ContactId value object that contains the contact ID.\nUsing Queries In this example, we will be working with edition in a Contact CRUD Form.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s inject QueryBus instance into the Form Data Provider.\n#src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/form/form_data_provider.ymlprestashop.core.form.identifiable_object.data_provider.contact_form_data_provider:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider\\ContactFormDataProvider\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.query_bus\u0026#39;and in ContactFormDataProvider:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Form\\IdentifiableObject\\DataProvider; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\CommandBus\\CommandBusInterface; final class ContactFormDataProvider implements FormDataProviderInterface { /** * @var CommandBusInterface */ private $queryBus; /** * @param CommandBusInterface $queryBus */ public function __construct(CommandBusInterface $queryBus) { $this-\u0026gt;queryBus = $queryBus; } } The first step is completed – the Query Bus is injected in the Form Data Provider.

The code in PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain namespace started to utilize domain exceptions.\nWhat is a domain exception A domain exception is an exception, that is thrown in application\u0026rsquo;s domain level, which is specific to that particular domain. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how domain exceptions look like in the code. For this example, let\u0026rsquo;s look at Category domain:\nsrc/Core/Domain/Category/ . ├── Command ├── CommandHandler ├── Exception │ ├── CannotAddCategoryException.php │ ├── CannotDeleteImageException.php │ ├── CannotDeleteRootCategoryForShopException.php │ ├── CannotEditCategoryException.php │ ├── CannotUpdateCategoryStatusException.php │ ├── CategoryConstraintException.php │ ├── CategoryException.php │ ├── CategoryNotFoundException.php │ ├── FailedToDeleteCategoryException.php │ └── MenuThumbnailsLimitException.php ├── Query ├── QueryHandler ├── QueryResult └── ValueObject We can see the Exception directory, which contains all category domain exceptions.\nAll domain exceptions are extending a base exception class. In case of categories, all category exceptions are extending CategoryException, which defines the Category domain, and CategoryException extends PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Exception\\DomainException, which defines the PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s domain.\nExample usage of domain exceptions Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze one exception from Category domain, CannotEditCategoryException:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Category\\Exception; /** * Class CannotEditCategoryException is thrown when editing category fails. */ class CannotEditCategoryException extends CategoryException { } As we can guess from the comment in the code, this exception is supposed to be thrown when editing a category fails. Let\u0026rsquo;s see a real usage in a command handler:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Adapter/Category/CommandHandler/EditCategoryHandler.php  private function updateCategoryFromCommandData(Category $category, EditCategoryCommand $command) { // ...  if (false === $category-\u0026gt;update()) { throw new CannotEditCategoryException( sprintf(\u0026#39;Failed to edit Category with id \u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;.\u0026#39;, $category-\u0026gt;id) ); } }  If you are not familiar with command handlers or how CQRS pattern is used in PrestaShop, you can read about it here: CQRS. We can see in the code above, that if category update fails, it will throw a CannotEditCategoryException. The exception then needs to be handled in the upper layers of the code.\nIn our example all category domain exceptions are handled in the CategoryController:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin/Sell/Catalog/CategoryController.php  public function editAction($categoryId, Request $request) { try { $editableCategory = $this-\u0026gt;getQueryBus()-\u0026gt;handle(new GetCategoryForEditing((int) $categoryId)); } catch (CategoryException $e) { // Catching all exceptions from category domain  // and showing a specific error message for every exception type.  $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;error\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;getErrorMessageForException($e, $this-\u0026gt;getErrorMessages())); } // ... } So now, if we are editing a category and it fails for some reason (e.g. the database is not responding), the controller will catch the CannotEditCategoryException (which is a child of CategoryException) and display a specific error message to the user.\nWhy are there so many new exception classes ? Having many different exception classes means that developers can easily recognize specific failures in the system. Just as we recognized category editing failure in our example, we can catch any particular exception and it will tell us what exactly failed in the runtime.\nFor example, catching a CategoryNotFoundException lets us know when category is not found, or catching CannotAddCategoryException means that a category cannot be added. These exceptions carry an accurate information that makes it easier to debug the issue or to handle the usecase gracefully by displaying the right error message for example.\nIf we expand our previous example with a better overview with different exception types:\n\u0026lt;?php public function editAction($categoryId, Request $request) { try { $editableCategory = $this-\u0026gt;getQueryBus()-\u0026gt;handle(new GetCategoryForEditing((int) $categoryId)); } catch (CannotEditCategoryException $e) { // Here we handle the case when category cannot be edited, like display a specific error message and suggestions to fix it.  $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;error\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Something went wrong when editing category.\u0026#39;); } catch (CategoryNotFoundException $e) { // Here we can do specific actions if the user is trying to edit a category that cannot be found, like redirect to category listing.  $this-\u0026gt;addFlash(\u0026#39;error\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Category cannot be found!\u0026#39;); } // ... } "

This tutorial is a shortcut to write tests but the full documentation is available on the Behat website.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we want to check that the computation of a cart price is correctly impacted by a Free Shipping coupon.\nWe will:\n write this scenario as a human-readable text convert it to gherkin syntax run it using Behat  Write a new scenario and feature We will first write our feature. We can either add it to one of the existing .feature files in folder tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario/ or create a new feature file. If the new feature file is in a new folder, you need to update the main Behat configuration file tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml to either add this folder to one of the existing test suites or to create a new test suite.\nFor this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll add the new scenario to the tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Scenario/Cart/Calculation/CartRule/free_shipping.feature file.\nThe scenario we want to test is the following:\nOnmy shop, there is only 1 carrier which can ship my productsAnd his shipping fees of 5.0 euros in zone \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; for product whose price ranges between 0 and 150 eurosI start with an empty default cartI add a standard product into my cart, the price of the product is 50.0 eurosSo my cart price is currently 55 eurosI use a cart rule with code \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; that provides free shippingThen my cart price is now 50 euros !Then I convert it to use Gherkin syntax. This means each step must start with Given, When or Then. We can also use And which is an alias for the latest prefix used.\nScenario:With free shipping voucher, there is no shipping feesGiven On my shop, there is only 1 carrier which can ship my productsAnd his shipping fees of 5.0 euros in zone \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; for product whose price ranges between 0 and 150 eurosGiven I start with an empty default cartAnd I add a standard product into my cart, the price of the product is 50.0 eurosThen my cart price is currently 55 eurosWhen I use a cart rule with code \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; that provides free shippingThen my cart price is now 50 euros !There is no rule that requires to use Given, When or Then. You could use Then everywhere but usually we say that:\n Given steps are used to lay the ground for the scenario, to describe existing items When steps are used to trigger something, to make an event happen which modifies the software state Then steps are used to validate the software state, to check it behaves as expected  We have now written a valid gherkin scenario !\nRun Behat on this new scenario This scenario is now runnable by Behat. I add it to the free_shipping.feature file. Now this scenario is part of the PrestaShop testing suite for Behat !\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what happens if I run the whole feature to see the output:\n# from the PrestaShop root folder php ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml --name=\u0026#34;free shipping\u0026#34; (I use the --name filter to allow Behat to target my specific file, and not all the available tests)\nWe can see that Behat detects that some steps are not defined yet and suggests to create them for me:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; cart suite has undefined steps. Please choose the context to generate snippets: That is one great asset from Behat: if it is unable to match one of the steps with one existing regexp, it can generate snippets ready-to-use for us !\nHowever I am rather going to check into existing Context files (in tests/Integration/Behaviour/Features/Context/ folder) to see if I can re-use existing steps. It\u0026rsquo;s better to avoid unnecessary duplication.\nLuckily for me, it seems I can use existing steps for my whole feature! So we do not need to add new Behat steps in the Context file. We will however see later how to add a new step.\nBack to my usecase: I check available existing steps from either the other Feature files or the Context files, so I can reuse them to replace all the steps I have written by steps that are already understandable by Behat.\nHere is my scenario now:\nScenario:With free shipping voucher, there is no shipping fees# Start with an empty cartGiven I have an empty default cart# We need a productAnd there is a product in the catalog named \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; with a price of 50.0 and 1000 items in stock# We define the standard PrestaShop localisation tree: zone \u0026gt; country \u0026gt; state \u0026gt; addressAnd there is a zone named \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a country named \u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and iso code \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a state named \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34; with iso code \u0026#34;TEST-1\u0026#34; in country\u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is an address named \u0026#34;address1\u0026#34; with postcode \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; in state \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34;# We need a carrier with shipping feesGiven there is a carrier named \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34;And carrier \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34; applies shipping fees of 5.0 in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34; for price between 0 and 150# Create the voucherGiven there is a cart rule named \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; that applies no discount with priority 4, quantity of 1000 and quantity per user 1000And cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; offers free shippingAnd cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; has a discount code \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;When I add 1 items of product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; in my cart# 57 because product = 50 € + 5 € (carrier shipping fees) + 2 € (default carrier handling cost)Then my cart total should be 57.0 tax includedWhen I use the discount \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;Then my cart total should be 50.0 tax includedThis one is valid: Behat is able to match each of the lines with one Context step. And if I run my command, I can see Behat go through the whole scenario successfully. This means that my free shipping voucher behavior is correct: Behat has checked that the cart total, after using the voucher, has no shipping fees.\nMy feature is validated by Behat !\nAdding a new step Now we are going to add a new step that is not yet supported by existing Contexts.\nFor example, have you noticed that the cart price is, before free shipping, 57€ and not 55€ ? It is because the step Given there is a carrier named \u0026quot;carrier1\u0026quot; generates a standard carrier whose handling cost is 2 by default. So when shipping fees are added, the handling cost is added too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we want to remove this handling cost and only keep the shipping fees. This way my cart price will, without free shipping, be 55€ and not 57€.\nSo we need to add a new step: Given the carrier \u0026quot;carrier1\u0026quot; has no handling costs.\nThis step is unknown to Behat, so we will need to help Behat \u0026ldquo;understand it\u0026rdquo;.\nWe add the step to the scenario and we run again\n# from the PrestaShop root folder php ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml --name=\u0026#34;free shipping\u0026#34; Again, Behat detects the unmatched step and warns me suite has undefined steps. Please choose the context to generate snippets:.\nI accept the help of Behat and let him generate a snippet ready-to-use for me for my step.\nI choose to put the new step into Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CarrierFeatureContext as it is related to carriers. The generated snippet looks like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * @Given the carrier :arg1 has no handling costs */ public function theCarrierHasNoHandlingCosts($arg1) { throw new PendingException(); } I can pick it, copy it into CarrierFeatureContext file and implement it.\nImplementing a Behat step means: performing the required process, be it call functions, perform SQL queries, that are required by the action \u0026ldquo;carrier has no costs\u0026rdquo;. I also rename the function and improve the regular expression provided by Behat.\nAfter I have implemented it, this is what my step looks like:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * @Given the carrier :carrierName has no handling costs */ public function carrierHasNoHandlingCosts($carrierName) { // check a carrier with this name exists  $this-\u0026gt;checkCarrierWithNameExists($carrierName); // fetch the carrier  $carrier = $this-\u0026gt;carriers[$carrierName]; // disable handling cost  $carrier-\u0026gt;shipping_handling = false: $carrier-\u0026gt;save(); } Now I update my scenario:\nScenario:With free shipping voucher, there is no shipping fees# Start with an empty cartGiven I have an empty default cart# We need a productAnd there is a product in the catalog named \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; with a price of 50.0 and 1000 items in stock# We define the standard PrestaShop localisation tree: zone \u0026gt; country \u0026gt; state \u0026gt; addressAnd there is a zone named \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a country named \u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and iso code \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a state named \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34; with iso code \u0026#34;TEST-1\u0026#34; in country\u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is an address named \u0026#34;address1\u0026#34; with postcode \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; in state \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34;# We need a carrier with shipping feesGiven there is a carrier named \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34;Given the carrier \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34; has no handling costsAnd carrier \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34; applies shipping fees of 5.0 in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34; for price between 0 and 150# Create the voucherGiven there is a cart rule named \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; that applies no discount with priority 4, quantity of 1000 and quantity per user 1000And cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; offers free shippingAnd cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; has a discount code \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;When I add 1 items of product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; in my cart# 55 because product = 50 € + 5 € (carrier shipping fees)Then my cart total should be 55.0 tax excludedWhen I use the discount \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;Then my cart total should be 50.0 tax includedHave you noticed my cart total, before using the voucher, is now 55€ and not 57€ ? And when this scenario is run by Behat, everything runs fine, so my calculations are correct !\nI have again a dedicated scenario that validates the behavior of my free shipping voucher.\n"

We will however see later how to add a new step.\nBack to my usecase: I check available existing steps from either the other Feature files or the Context files, so I can reuse them to replace all the steps I have written by steps that are already understandable by Behat.\nHere is my scenario now:\nScenario:With free shipping voucher, there is no shipping fees# Start with an empty cartGiven I have an empty default cart# We need a productAnd there is a product in the catalog named \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; with a price of 50.0 and 1000 items in stock# We define the standard PrestaShop localisation tree: zone \u0026gt; country \u0026gt; state \u0026gt; addressAnd there is a zone named \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a country named \u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and iso code \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a state named \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34; with iso code \u0026#34;TEST-1\u0026#34; in country\u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is an address named \u0026#34;address1\u0026#34; with postcode \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; in state \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34;# We need a carrier with shipping feesGiven there is a carrier named \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34;And carrier \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34; applies shipping fees of 5.0 in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34; for price between 0 and 150# Create the voucherGiven there is a cart rule named \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; that applies no discount with priority 4, quantity of 1000 and quantity per user 1000And cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; offers free shippingAnd cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; has a discount code \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;When I add 1 items of product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; in my cart# 57 because product = 50 € + 5 € (carrier shipping fees) + 2 € (default carrier handling cost)Then my cart total should be 57.0 tax includedWhen I use the discount \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;Then my cart total should be 50.0 tax includedThis one is valid: Behat is able to match each of the lines with one Context step. And if I run my command, I can see Behat go through the whole scenario successfully. This means that my free shipping voucher behavior is correct: Behat has checked that the cart total, after using the voucher, has no shipping fees.\nMy feature is validated by Behat !\nAdding a new step Now we are going to add a new step that is not yet supported by existing Contexts.\nFor example, have you noticed that the cart price is, before free shipping, 57€ and not 55€ ? It is because the step Given there is a carrier named \u0026quot;carrier1\u0026quot; generates a standard carrier whose handling cost is 2 by default. So when shipping fees are added, the handling cost is added too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we want to remove this handling cost and only keep the shipping fees. This way my cart price will, without free shipping, be 55€ and not 57€.\nSo we need to add a new step: Given the carrier \u0026quot;carrier1\u0026quot; has no handling costs.\nThis step is unknown to Behat, so we will need to help Behat \u0026ldquo;understand it\u0026rdquo;.\nWe add the step to the scenario and we run again\n# from the PrestaShop root folder php ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/Integration/Behaviour/behat.yml --name=\u0026#34;free shipping\u0026#34; Again, Behat detects the unmatched step and warns me suite has undefined steps. Please choose the context to generate snippets:.\nI accept the help of Behat and let him generate a snippet ready-to-use for me for my step.\nI choose to put the new step into Tests\\Integration\\Behaviour\\Features\\Context\\CarrierFeatureContext as it is related to carriers. The generated snippet looks like this:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * @Given the carrier :arg1 has no handling costs */ public function theCarrierHasNoHandlingCosts($arg1) { throw new PendingException(); } I can pick it, copy it into CarrierFeatureContext file and implement it.\nImplementing a Behat step means: performing the required process, be it call functions, perform SQL queries, that are required by the action \u0026ldquo;carrier has no costs\u0026rdquo;. I also rename the function and improve the regular expression provided by Behat.\nAfter I have implemented it, this is what my step looks like:\n\u0026lt;?php /** * @Given the carrier :carrierName has no handling costs */ public function carrierHasNoHandlingCosts($carrierName) { // check a carrier with this name exists  $this-\u0026gt;checkCarrierWithNameExists($carrierName); // fetch the carrier  $carrier = $this-\u0026gt;carriers[$carrierName]; // disable handling cost  $carrier-\u0026gt;shipping_handling = false: $carrier-\u0026gt;save(); } Now I update my scenario:\nScenario:With free shipping voucher, there is no shipping fees# Start with an empty cartGiven I have an empty default cart# We need a productAnd there is a product in the catalog named \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; with a price of 50.0 and 1000 items in stock# We define the standard PrestaShop localisation tree: zone \u0026gt; country \u0026gt; state \u0026gt; addressAnd there is a zone named \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a country named \u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and iso code \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is a state named \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34; with iso code \u0026#34;TEST-1\u0026#34; in country\u0026#34;country1\u0026#34; and zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34;And there is an address named \u0026#34;address1\u0026#34; with postcode \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; in state \u0026#34;state1\u0026#34;# We need a carrier with shipping feesGiven there is a carrier named \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34;Given the carrier \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34; has no handling costsAnd carrier \u0026#34;carrier1\u0026#34; applies shipping fees of 5.0 in zone \u0026#34;North America\u0026#34; for price between 0 and 150# Create the voucherGiven there is a cart rule named \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; that applies no discount with priority 4, quantity of 1000 and quantity per user 1000And cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; offers free shippingAnd cart rule \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34; has a discount code \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;When I add 1 items of product \u0026#34;product1\u0026#34; in my cart# 55 because product = 50 € + 5 € (carrier shipping fees)Then my cart total should be 55.0 tax excludedWhen I use the discount \u0026#34;free4behat\u0026#34;Then my cart total should be 50.0 tax includedHave you noticed my cart total, before using the voucher, is now 55€ and not 57€ ? And when this scenario is run by Behat, everything runs fine, so my calculations are correct !\nI have again a dedicated scenario that validates the behavior of my free shipping voucher.\n"

	"content": "How to upgrade PrestaShop Important\nDo not go further if you haven’t made a backup of your shop.\nRollback will be the only way to go back if something does not go well, and this requires a backup.\nLearn how to backup your shop\n This chapter describes several ways to complete an upgrade of PrestaShop.\nManual upgrade – Process details This guide gives you the full control on the process. This one has been applied by PrestaShop for several major versions, and thus can be applied on very old shops.\nRelease download The first step is to download the latest version on https://www.prestashop.com/.\nIf you upgrade to another version of PrestaShop 1.6, the release files can be found in a dedicated archives list.\nDownload can also be done in command line, as done here with the version 1.7.7.5:\nwget -O prestashop-upgrade.zip https://www.prestashop.com/download/old/prestashop_1.7.7.5.zip Archive extraction Extract the files from the archive with a tool like 7zip\nNote starting from PrestaShop 1.7.0.0, the release package contains a zip file itself, which must be extracted as well.\nOn a Linux terminal, you can use the command `unzip`:\nunzip prestashop-upgrade.zip \u0026amp;\u0026amp; unzip prestashop.zip Once you have the folders like classes/, modules/, themes/, etc. you may go on the next step.\nSample files cleanup Avoid overwrite the production resources (images, conf \u0026hellip;) with the default data. These folders can be removed from the new release:\n img/ override/  All the other files present in the new release will overwrite the existing files. All changes you made on the original source code will be lost (by the way, this is not recommended, you should never modify the core files).\nAlso, rename the “admin” folder to match your shop’s admin folder name. This will prevent an unwanted duplication of the administration content.\nTurning on maintenance mode The shop will now be modified. As it may cause unexpected behavior for you and your customers during the upgrade, we highly recommend you to turn on maintenance mode during the upgrade.\nThis can be done in your administration panel:\n On PrestaShop 1.7, in Shop parameters \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Maintenance tab On PrestaShop 1.6, in Shop parameters \u0026gt; Maintenance  Adding your IP address will allow you to access your shop while it’s in maintenance mode. That way, you can make sure everything is working right before allowing your customers to access it again.\nFile copy In this step, we \u0026ldquo;upgrade\u0026rdquo; the PrestaShop files by copying the new release content in the existing shop.\nDisable cache You may have activated a caching system (eg. memcache) on your shop. In that case, make sure to disable it in \u0026ldquo;Advanced Parameters\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Performance\u0026rdquo;. You can enable it again once the upgrade process is done.\nNote about vendor folder: Previous upgrades of PrestaShop 1.7 showed that conflicts may occur when merging the new vendor/ folder with the old one. To avoid this problem, we recommend to delete this folder in the existing shop before copying the new one.\nOn Windows, copy the new folder content and paste it in your shop folder. You will get warnings that files already exists in the destination folder. Choose “overwrite” to continue.\nOn linux, the copy can be done in your terminal:\ncp -R \u0026lt;path_to_the_new_release\u0026gt;/* \u0026lt;path_to_the_current_shop\u0026gt;/ Example:\ncp -R ~/Downloads/prestashop/* /var/www/html/ Database upgrade Once the files have been copied, your shop database is ready to be upgraded.\nSome web hosting providers gives you two user accounts to access your database. One with full privileges the other for using in scripts with limited rights. To be able to use this Database upgrade script you have to use the account with full privileges. All the changes to apply have been defined in the install folder, running them can be done with a specific PHP script.\nWhen you’re ready, run the file install/upgrade/upgrade.php.\nThis can be done with a browser, by reaching the address http://\u0026lt;shop_domain\u0026gt;/install/upgrade/upgrade.php, or from your server\u0026rsquo;s command line:\nphp install/upgrade/upgrade.php In both cases, an XML log will be displayed. The result can be found in the attribute result of the first tag \u0026lt;action\u0026gt;:\n ok if updates have been found and executed error if something went wrong info for next actions, displaying the details on the process  Execution log When the upgrade script found some upgrades to apply, the SQL queries run will be listed along their respective result.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;action result=\u0026#34;ok\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;action result=\u0026#34;info\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;1.7.0.5\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[OK] PHP 1.7.0.5 : /* PHP:ps_update_tabs(); */]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;action result=\u0026#34;info\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;1.7.0.5\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[OK] SQL 1.7.0.5 : ALTER TABLE `ps_currency` MODIFY `name` varchar(64) NOT NULL]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;action result=\u0026#34;info\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;1.7.1.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[OK] SQL 1.7.1.0 : SET SESSION sql_mode = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;action result=\u0026#34;info\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;1.7.1.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;![CDATA[[OK] SQL 1.7.1.0 : SET NAMES \u0026#39;utf8\u0026#39;]]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/action\u0026gt; [...] You can double check that each action is marked as “OK”. If not, additional details will be shown after the request, which can help you fix the issue and re-execute the request manually on your database. In some cases, you may need to restore your database backup and start over.\nError codes An error code can also be displayed. Each code is related to a message described here:\n Error #27: The shop is running a newer version than the content provided by the install folder. Error #28: The shop is already at the version you try to upgrade to. Error #29: Could not find the current version. Check your database parameters file and the database connection. Error #31: Unable to find upgrade directory in the installation path, does the folder install/upgrade/sql exist and is not empty? Error #32: No upgrade needs to be applied. Error #33: Error while loading a SQL upgrade file. Check your permissions of the folder install/upgrade/sql. Error #40: The version provided in the file install/install_version.php is invalid. Error #43: Error while upgrading database schema using doctrine. Error #44: Error while updating translations. Error #45: Error while enabling theme.  Cleanup Before going further, a few things should now be cleaned.\n The install folder, used to run the database upgrades, is not needed anymore and can be safely deleted. When opening your shop (in the front or back office) on your browser, you may see some visual issues. This can be due to your old assets being still served by a cache. Reload them by force-refreshing the page (press ctrl+R on Windows / Linux or cmd+R on Mac OS) or clearing your browser’s cache.  Modules upgrade Your modules files have been upgraded during the file copy, however many of them may require additional changes on the database. Please check the module page in your Back Office to see if upgrades are waiting to be run.\nGo to your administration panel and login. You will notice the version displayed has changed on the login page. Then in the menu, click on the module page to reach your catalog.\nOn PrestaShop 1.6, this page can be found in “Module \u0026amp; Services”. Click on “Update all” at the top of the page to run all available upgrades:\n On PrestaShop 1.7, the same feature can be found in the Improve \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Modules page, under the tab “Notifications”:\n 1-click upgrade module If the manual process seems too tedious, other solutions exist to complete an upgrade.\nPrestaShop provides the module 1-click upgrade for free on the marketplace and your shop administration panel. It executes the previously given process automatically, and is available for almost all versions of PrestaShop.\nYou can read more about it here.\nSupport service Doing an upgrade by yourself can be risky. If you feel uncomfortable with doing it on your own, you can leave it to our support team who will handle the backup and the upgrade to the last minor version for you (1.6 → 1.6, 1.7 → 1.7 etc.).\nBasically, the process and the result will be the same. The existing data on the shop will be kept, as well as your module and your current theme.\nYou can subscribe for the upgrade service on the marketplace.\nMany agencies and freelancers in your area may also provide this kind of service.\n"

	"content": "Payment modules PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new payment API. Below, you\u0026rsquo;ll find information about how it works and also, how to migrate your module from PrestaShop 1.6 (and earlier) to PrestaShop 1.7.\nThe main reason why the change was needed is on the customer side: Now, there is only one button to validate the order, not one by payment module anymore.\nThe bankwire module is an example of how a payment module for PS 1.6 is migrated to PS 1.7 API. A skeleton is also available on GitHub.\nPlease note that your module won\u0026rsquo;t be listed in payment methods admin page unless it is referenced in the official list. However you can still configure it through the Module Manager.\nRequirements To make a payment module for PrestaShop 1.7, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to respect some elements:\n  Your class will have to extend PaymentModule.\n  You will need to declare the following namespace.\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Payment\\PaymentOption;   You\u0026rsquo;ll have to register the two following methods: hookPaymentOptions() \u0026amp; hookPaymentReturn() and register these hooks.\n  You must not have a submit button into your module\u0026rsquo;s HTML code. It will automatically be generated by PrestaShop.\n  In the hookPaymentOptions() method, you have to return an array of PaymentOption.\nHow to generate your PaymentOption PaymentOption Here is a list of the PaymentOption class variables. They all have a getter and a setter and are accessible in the array sent to the front office template.\n $callToActionText: The text displayed as the payment method name. $additionalInformation: Additional information to display to the customer. This is free HTML, and may be used by modules such as bankwire to display to which account the bank transfer should be made. $logo: The URL to a picture to display in the payment option selection widget. $action: The URL to which the request to process the payment must be made. $inputs: An associative array of additional parameters to use when sending the request to $action. $form: The custom HTML to display like a form to enter the credit card information. $iframe: The custom HTML containing an iframe with the payment confirmation widget for modules like ATOS. $moduleName: The name of the module. $binary: A boolean to set if the module form was generated by binaries and contains a submit button. It\u0026rsquo;s necessary to adapt the behavior.  PaymentOption types You can find a example module illustrating the four identified cases of payment modules on GitHub.\nWe have identified four cases of payment module:\nOffline : This is the most simple case where you could be (e.g.:Bankwire, Cheque). It\u0026rsquo;s a simple URL to call, then various information are displayed to the customer.\nThe minimal variables to set are `$callToActionText` and `$action`. You can check the `getOfflinePaymentOption()` method of *[paymentexample](https://github.com/PrestaShop/paymentexample)* to have an example.  External : It\u0026rsquo;s a simple URL to call, then the payment is directly processed on the Payment Service Provider\u0026rsquo;s website (e.g.: PayPal, Paybox).\nThe minimal variables to set are `$callToActionText` and `$action`. The form will be sent by POST and you can add hidden inputs such as a token, by using `setInput()` method. You can check the `getExternalPaymentOption()` method of *[paymentexample](https://github.com/PrestaShop/paymentexample)* to have an example.  Embedded : You write your credit card number and all the required data directly on the merchant\u0026rsquo;s website (e.g.: Stripe).\nThe minimal variables to set are `$callToActionText` and `$form`. You can check the `getEmbeddedPaymentOption()` method of *[paymentexample](https://github.com/PrestaShop/paymentexample)* to have an example.  iFrame : The payment form is displayed on the merchant\u0026rsquo;s website, but inside an iFrame.\nThe minimal variables to set are `$callToActionText` and `$additionalInformation`. You can check the `getIframePaymentOption()` method of *[paymentexample](https://github.com/PrestaShop/paymentexample)* to have an example.  Migrating from 1.6 to 1.7 How-To You need to change the payment hook where your module is hooked on by paymentOption. It\u0026rsquo;s not a display hook anymore, so you must not use the $this-\u0026gt;display() method to retrieve a template, but use the $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;smarty-\u0026gt;fetch() method instead.\nThen, implement the hookPaymentOptions() function to return an array of PaymentOption.\nNext, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to identify the type of your payment module to know which variables are mandatory.\nWhat if I can\u0026rsquo;t remove the submit button? As you may read it above, you must not have a submit button into your module\u0026rsquo;s HTML code, because PrestaShop will automatically generate it. If you can\u0026rsquo;t remove the submit button from the form for some reasons (e.g.: the form is generated by binaries), we have implemented another way to make your module PrestaShop 1.7 compatible. But, note that this is NOT the recommended way to do it.\nTo do this, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to implement a supplementary hook: displayPaymentByBinaries. It\u0026rsquo;s made to display the payment form, and it will replace the unique payment button in the checkout.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll also need to set the $binary variable to true. It will adapt the behavior to hide the payment button and replace it by the form when the payment option is selected.\nHooks The params passed to the following hooks have been modified:\n hookPaymentReturn hookDisplayOrderConfirmation  BEFORE    Key Value     total_to_pay Result of $order-\u0026gt;getOrdersTotalPaid()   currency Currency sign (string)   currencyObj The loaded currency (Currency class)   objOrder The current order object (Order class)    AFTER    Key Value     order The current order object (Order class)    Everything can be retrieved, for example:\n\u0026lt;?php $currency = new Currency($params[\u0026#39;order\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;id_currency); $total_to_pay = $params[\u0026#39;order\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;getOrdersTotalPaid(); "

	"content": "Release the version publicly Once the QA team has greenlighted your build, you can move forward with the public release.\nMake certain you have go for publish! Also, avoid starting this process after 4 PM or on a Friday. 1. Merge security PRs on GitHub If there are unmerged security PRs:\n Merge them on GitHub and publishing their security advisories. Rebase the local build branch that you created on the previous step to remove the merge commits from the security PRs you merged manually before.  2. Merge the updated changelog and contributors list Starting from your local build branch:\n Double check your branch and verify it contains only the updated contributors list and the new changelog.\nThe commit named // Changelog [version] should be the last one. Create a Pull Request to merge this change.  3. Tag \u0026amp; release on GitHub Tag the version using git You can do this step using Git or directly on GitHub on the next step.  Check out the commit named // Changelog [version] Tag the new version: git tag 1.7.2.0 # replace by your version git push --tags   Publish the release on GitHub Create a new Release Draft on GitHub\n  Either:\n Pick the tag that you created in the previous step Create the tag by picking the Changelog commit that you just merged.\n⚠️ Make sure you pick the Changelog commit itself, not the PR\u0026rsquo;s merge commit!    Paste the change log as a description\n  If you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a version (including beta and RC releases) that includes changes from a previous pre-release version:\n Include a note explaining what other changes are included (Example) Precede the changelog with the title \u0026ldquo;Changes since beta XX / RC YY\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; (Example)    If you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a pre-release version:\n Make sure to add a \u0026ldquo;Known issues\u0026rdquo; section (Example) Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check the \u0026ldquo;This a pre-release\u0026rdquo; checkbox at the bottom of the form    If you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a patch version:\n Write a short intro explaining what the release fixes – especially if it\u0026rsquo;s a security release! (Example)      Upload the new version zip archive (the one that has been validated by QA).\nRemove the build number from the file name to avoid confusions.\n  If the Changelog content is too long It\u0026rsquo;s not unusual to have very long changelogs, especially in minor versions.

	"content": "Release the version publicly Once the QA team has greenlighted your build, you can move forward with the public release.\nMake certain you have go for publish! Also, avoid starting this process after 4 PM or on a Friday. 1. Merge security PRs on GitHub If there are unmerged security PRs:\n Merge them on GitHub and publishing their security advisories. Rebase the local build branch that you created on the previous step to remove the merge commits from the security PRs you merged manually before.  2. Merge the updated changelog and contributors list Starting from your local build branch:\n Double check your branch and verify it contains only the updated contributors list and the new changelog.\nThe commit named // Changelog [version] should be the last one. Create a Pull Request to merge this change.  3. Tag \u0026amp; release on GitHub Tag the version using git You can do this step using Git or directly on GitHub on the next step.  Check out the commit named // Changelog [version] Tag the new version: git tag 1.7.2.0 # replace by your version git push --tags   Publish the release on GitHub Create a new Release Draft on GitHub\n  Either:\n Pick the tag that you created in the previous step Create the tag by picking the Changelog commit that you just merged.\n⚠️ Make sure you pick the Changelog commit itself, not the PR\u0026rsquo;s merge commit!    Paste the change log as a description\n  If you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a version (including beta and RC releases) that includes changes from a previous pre-release version:\n Include a note explaining what other changes are included (Example) Precede the changelog with the title \u0026ldquo;Changes since beta XX / RC YY\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; (Example)    If you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a pre-release version:\n Make sure to add a \u0026ldquo;Known issues\u0026rdquo; section (Example) Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check the \u0026ldquo;This a pre-release\u0026rdquo; checkbox at the bottom of the form    If you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a patch version:\n Write a short intro explaining what the release fixes – especially if it\u0026rsquo;s a security release! (Example)      Upload the new version zip archive (the one that has been validated by QA).\nRemove the build number from the file name to avoid confusions.\n  If the Changelog content is too long It\u0026rsquo;s not unusual to have very long changelogs, especially in minor versions.

	"content": "Reviewing Pull Requests The code review process is generally regarded as a good practice and is adopted by hundreds of software projects around the world.\nIt provides lot of benefits:\n it helps spotting errors in the code, because we all make mistakes and it can be hard to find one\u0026rsquo;s own mistakes. it helps improving code quality not only by ensuring it\u0026rsquo;s readable and understandable, but also by pinpointing design, performance or security issues that may have been unintentionally introduced by the author. it helps spread knowledge of the code base, because the reviewer will learn how your code works too.  Reviewing is a discussion, not a to-do list. The main goal is to find the best solution by sharing different points of view. Approving Pull Requests Maintainers are responsible for the Pull Requests they approve. The main objective of this process is to make sure that the change being reviewed does not produce undesired side effects and that it\u0026rsquo;s inclusion is coherent with the project\u0026rsquo;s objectives.\nHere are the rules for approving a Pull Request:\n The change must follow the contribution guidelines, including:  Coding standards License \u0026amp; license headers Proper description   The change must not introduce evident regressions (including breaking changes) nor substantially increase entropy, unless it\u0026rsquo;s properly justified. The change must provide enough value to be worth merging.  Fulfilling the above requirements does not automatically imply that such a contribution must be accepted.\nConversely, non-compliant contributions should not be accepted. Collaborate with other teams Pull Requests introduce into the codebase many kinds of changes.\nSome Pull Requests do fix bugs. Sometimes the fix is done in a simple way, and the review is easy, sometimes the solution is more complex, and the reviewer must evaluate whether the submitted solution is good or if a better (simpler?) is desirable. It is recommended in such cases to ask for the opinion of other maintainers.\nSome Pull Requests do introduce new behavior changes (a new button, a new Back-Office page, a new feature\u0026hellip;) . If the change is impactful, such Pull Requests cannot be merged without the Product Team approval. It can be asked by marking the Pull Request and/or the related Issue with label \u0026ldquo;Waiting for PM\u0026rdquo; and Product Team will mark validated changes with label \u0026ldquo;PM ✓\u0026rdquo;.\nSome Pull Requests do introduce new UX changes (changing a layout, modifying a color\u0026hellip;) . If the change is impactful, such Pull Requests cannot be merged without the UX Team approval. It can be asked by marking the Pull Request and/or the related Issue with label \u0026ldquo;Waiting for UX\u0026rdquo; and UX Team will mark validated changes with label \u0026ldquo;UX ✓\u0026rdquo;.\nSome Pull Requests do introduce new wording changes. Usually, Prestonbot will detect such Pull Requests and automatically add the \u0026ldquo;Waiting for wording\u0026rdquo; label. The Wording Team will review the Pull Request and work with the author until it is valid. At this moment the Pull Request is labelled \u0026ldquo;Wording ✓\u0026rdquo;. Without this label, such Pull Requests cannot be merged.\nSome Pull Requests do introduce new technical changes (a new dependency, a new extensibility mechanism)\u0026hellip; If the change is impactful, it is recommended for Pull Requests to ask for the opinion of multiple maintainers. For changes that are important, a Voting phase might be needed.\nAll these Teams can be reached out on the Slack channel.\nDiscussing with author During review, maintainers can ask questions to the Pull Request author (for example to better understand a technical choice). Simply writing the question as a comment is enough.\nWhen doing so, it is recommended to add the label \u0026ldquo;Waiting for author\u0026rdquo; on the Pull Request. This helps other maintainers to know this Pull Request state.\nBots helping maintainers There are multiple bots that monitor the Issues and Pull Requests on GitHub.\nPrestonbot will try to add relevant informations on new Pull Requests and evaluate whether there are missing/invalid items. Following the Pull Request template, Prestonbot will add labels on the Pull Requests.\nLists of red flags Here is a list of things that should not be approved in a Pull Request\n Anti-patterns or code that clearly violates software development best practices such as SOLID principles. Code that does not comply with current PrestaShop architecture, unless for good reasons (example: some View logic inside the Model layer). Code that scales poorly and/or performs poorly. Code that is very hard to read and consequently less maintainable. Code that ignores one standard PrestaShop usecase (example: logic that only makes sense for EU rules or USA rules). Code that ignores part of PrestaShop user audience (example: CSS that is not RTL-compliant). Code that is not secure.  More details available here.\nAbout BC breaks Since PrestaShop follows SemVer, we should not accept Pull Requests introducing Breaking Changes unless they will be delivered in a new Major version.\nExceptions to this rule can however be made, for good reasons only such as:\n Security issue that cannot be fixed in a backward compatible manner Architecture/Design issue that cannot be fixed in an efficient and backward compatible manner Expected and announced beforehand change such as migrating a legacy page into a Symfony page  Maintainers are gatekeepers Approving a Pull Request is actually a meaningful act. It carries multiple messages:\n1. The submitted code is correct and its quality meets our expectations.\nThis is obviously a requirement for the Pull Request to be approved.\n2. The outcome of this Pull Request is desirable.\nSome Pull Requests are correct but are not merged because they do not benefit the project. For example a Pull Request that enables the support of XCF format for images is likely to be rejected as this image format is very rarely used in eCommerce.\n3. We accept to introduce this new code into our scope.\nCode that is merged inside the project becomes part of its scope. It means the maintainers team agree to maintain, manage, test, document and update this code as if it was their own.\nPart of the Pull Request might also be integrated into PrestaShop public API which must evolve in a backward compatible manner to comply with SemVer. This means that once that it is released, it is quite frozen and must be preserved.\nMerging Pull Requests A Pull Request may only be merged after the following requirements have been fulfilled:\n The change must not have any outstanding merge conflicts. The change has been approved by at least one maintainer (two maintainers for the PrestaShop Core repository). Automated checks (including automated tests) are passing. The change has been approved by the QA team using the \u0026ldquo;QA ✓\u0026rdquo; label, unless there\u0026rsquo;s a general agreement that the change is not testable by QA.  Marking merged Pull Requests When merging a Pull Request on the Core Repository, maintainer must do the following, if it has not been done by someone else:\n Link the Pull Request to the right milestone. The milestone to choose is the next target release. Add the label \u0026ldquo;Key feature\u0026rdquo; if the Pull Request must be mentioned in the Release Note. Add the label \u0026ldquo;BC break\u0026rdquo; if the Pull Request introduces a BC Break.  The items above are very important as they will be key to writing a good Release Note and ChangeLog for the next version.\nIt is also recommended to :\n Thank the Pull Request author and anybody else who invested notable energy into the Pull Request (code review, code suggestions, QA validation, usecase specification \u0026hellip;). If the Pull Request is related to an issue, check whether the issue is fixed and closed (it might be done automatically depending on the Pull Request) and whether it should be.  Stale Pull Requests Pull Requests may be closed after 30 days of inactivity following a request for modifications.\n"

All you have to do is use the legacy configuration adapter (more on that later).\nBut what if you want to fetch a configuration value with more than one activated shop? This is where the ShopConstraint value object (VO) comes in handy, this is what you will use in order to specify which store(s) configuration value you are targeting.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what is a value object, you will find out about it and its use in the value objects documentation. Usage In order to fetch a configuration value in multistore context, you will need the legacy configuration adapter service prestashop.adapter.legacy.configuration and a ShopConstraint instance PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Shop\\ValueObject\\ShopConstraint.\nExample:\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Shop\\ValueObject\\ShopConstraint; class MyController { // ...  public function myAction() { // ...  // Get the legacy configuration adapter service  $configuration = $container-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.legacy.configuration\u0026#39;); // Instantiate a ShopConstraint value object  $shopConstraint = new ShopConstraint( (int) $order-\u0026gt;id_shop, (int) $order-\u0026gt;id_shop_group ); // Get the needed configuration value, passing your ShopConstraint object as a third parameter  $roundType = (int) $configuration-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;PS_ROUND_TYPE\u0026#39;, null, $shopConstraint); // ...  } }  Note that the ShopConstraint VO is not solely dedicated to being used with the configuration service. If you write a method/function that should have different behaviors depending on a given shop / shop group, then using the ShopConstraint VO is a good idea. Fetched configuration values depending on context This is how configuration values are stored in database, depending on the current shop context (in the table ps_configuration):\n   Current context configuration name id_shop id_shop_group value     All shops context PS_SHOP_ENABLE NULL NULL \u0026lsquo;all shops value\u0026rsquo;   Group shop context (ex: shop group\u0026rsquo;s id is 2) PS_SHOP_ENABLE NULL 2 \u0026lsquo;group shop value\u0026rsquo;   Single shop context (ex: shop\u0026rsquo;s id is 3 and its group id is 2 ) PS_SHOP_ENABLE 3 2 \u0026lsquo;single shop value\u0026rsquo;    Note that setting the value of a parent context does not override the values for children contexts that were set before. For example, if a configuration value is set for a single shop, setting a configuration value in all shops context will not override it. When fetching a configuration value, the configuration service will look for the corresponding value for the current context, if there is none, you will get the configuration value for the next parent context having a configuration value, it goes from the most precise to the most generic context:\nSingle shop =\u0026gt; Group shop =\u0026gt; All shops\nFor example, if you are in single shop context but no configuration value is set for this shop, then if there is a configuration value for the shop group, you will get it, otherwise you will get the \u0026ldquo;all shops\u0026rdquo; value as a default.\n"

	"content": "Creating a carrier module Principles A carrier module is a regular PrestaShop module, except that it extends the CarrierModule class instead of the Module class:\nclass MyOwnCarrier extends CarrierModule It can be attached to the following hooks:\n extraCarrier: to display the shipping price depending on the ranges that were set in the back office.  A carrier module must use the following methods:\n getOrderShippingCost(): to compute the shipping price depending on the ranges that were set in the back office. getOrderShippingCostExternal(): to compute the shipping price without using the ranges.  The getPackageShippingCost() method can also be used to compute the shipping price depending on the products:\n$shipping_cost = $module-\u0026gt;getPackageShippingCost($cart, $shipping_cost, $products);  One module can be used to create more than one carrier. Watch out! Every time a Back Office user edits a carrier, what actually happens is that the carrier is duplicated, the copy is edited and the original is edited. Consequently, the field id_carrier of the new entry is different from the original . If you want to create a module related to a specific carrier, make sure to use the id_reference field which does not change upon edition. If you need to monitor the changes of the id of this carrier, make sure to read \u0026ldquo;Controlling the change of the carrier\u0026rsquo;s ID\u0026rdquo; section. Installing and uninstalling the module The module must handle:\n Its own installation, and the installation of one or more carriers. Its own uninstallation, and the \u0026ldquo;deletion\u0026rdquo; of one or more of its carriers.  Note about deletion:\n Deleting a carrier simply means its deactivation (deleted=true). The module must keep the link between an old order and a carrier that is not available anymore. Careful: the default carrier must exist and be enabled.  Controlling the change of the carrier\u0026rsquo;s ID To control the change of the carrier\u0026rsquo;s ID (id_carrier), the module must use the updateCarrier hook.\nFor instance:\npublic function hookUpdateCarrier($params) { $id_carrier_old = (int) $params[\u0026#39;id_carrier\u0026#39;]; $id_carrier_new = (int) $params[\u0026#39;carrier\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;id; if ($id_carrier_old === (int) Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_CARRIER_ID\u0026#39;)) { Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_CARRIER_ID\u0026#39;, $id_carrier_new); } } Computing the shipping price To compute the shipping price, PrestaShop needs to call the module\u0026rsquo;s getOrderShippingCost() or getOrderShippingCostExternal().\nThe returned value must be a float or false if the carrier is not known or disabled.\nFor instance:\npublic function getOrderShippingCost($params, $shipping_cost) { if ( $this-\u0026gt;id_carrier === (int)(Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_CARRIER_ID\u0026#39;)) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_OVERCOST\u0026#39;) \u0026gt; 1 ) { return (float)(Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER1_OVERCOST\u0026#39;)); } return false; // carrier is not known } "

The getPackageShippingCost() method can also be used to compute the shipping price depending on the products:\n$shipping_cost = $module-\u0026gt;getPackageShippingCost($cart, $shipping_cost, $products);  One module can be used to create more than one carrier. Watch out! Every time a Back Office user edits a carrier, what actually happens is that the carrier is duplicated, the copy is edited and the original is edited. Consequently, the field id_carrier of the new entry is different from the original . If you want to create a module related to a specific carrier, make sure to use the id_reference field which does not change upon edition. If you need to monitor the changes of the id of this carrier, make sure to read \u0026ldquo;Controlling the change of the carrier\u0026rsquo;s ID\u0026rdquo; section. Installing and uninstalling the module The module must handle:\n Its own installation, and the installation of one or more carriers. Its own uninstallation, and the \u0026ldquo;deletion\u0026rdquo; of one or more of its carriers.  Note about deletion:\n Deleting a carrier simply means its deactivation (deleted=true). The module must keep the link between an old order and a carrier that is not available anymore. Careful: the default carrier must exist and be enabled.  Controlling the change of the carrier\u0026rsquo;s ID To control the change of the carrier\u0026rsquo;s ID (id_carrier), the module must use the updateCarrier hook.\nFor instance:\npublic function hookUpdateCarrier($params) { $id_carrier_old = (int) $params[\u0026#39;id_carrier\u0026#39;]; $id_carrier_new = (int) $params[\u0026#39;carrier\u0026#39;]-\u0026gt;id; if ($id_carrier_old === (int) Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_CARRIER_ID\u0026#39;)) { Configuration::updateValue(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_CARRIER_ID\u0026#39;, $id_carrier_new); } } Computing the shipping price To compute the shipping price, PrestaShop needs to call the module\u0026rsquo;s getOrderShippingCost() or getOrderShippingCostExternal().\nThe returned value must be a float or false if the carrier is not known or disabled.\nFor instance:\npublic function getOrderShippingCost($params, $shipping_cost) { if ( $this-\u0026gt;id_carrier === (int)(Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_CARRIER_ID\u0026#39;)) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER_OVERCOST\u0026#39;) \u0026gt; 1 ) { return (float)(Configuration::get(\u0026#39;MYCARRIER1_OVERCOST\u0026#39;)); } return false; // carrier is not known } "

In the end javascript is only used to replace the content of HTML placeholders.\nEach ajax call will regenerate the following templates:\n catalog/_partials/products-top.tpl catalog/_partials/products.tpl catalog/_partials/products-bottom.tpl  How to update the view PrestaShop will emit JavaScript events to let you know what to do something.\nExample:\nimport $ from \u0026#39;jquery\u0026#39;; import prestashop from \u0026#39;prestashop\u0026#39;; import \u0026#39;velocity-animate\u0026#39;; $(document).ready(() =\u0026gt; { prestashop.on(\u0026#39;updateProductList\u0026#39;, (data) =\u0026gt; { updateProductListDOM(data); }); }); function updateProductListDOM (data) { $(\u0026#39;#search_filters\u0026#39;).replaceWith(data.rendered_facets); $(\u0026#39;#js-active-search-filters\u0026#39;).replaceWith(data.rendered_active_filters); $(\u0026#39;#js-product-list-top\u0026#39;).replaceWith(data.rendered_products_top); $(\u0026#39;#js-product-list\u0026#39;).replaceWith(data.rendered_products); $(\u0026#39;#js-product-list-bottom\u0026#39;).replaceWith(data.rendered_products_bottom); } "

Here is how it looks like:\n Multistore configuration form dropdown   If you are building a configuration form and you want the form to be aware of the current multistore context, then you must make your form compatible with multistore checkboxes. This is made possible thanks to Symfony\u0026rsquo;s form extensions mechanism.\nCreating a multistore compatible configuration form You will find a concrete example of how a configuration form is made multistore-compatible on this github pull-request. A Symfony form extension called MultistoreConfigurationTypeExtension has been created in order to make it easy to add multistore checkboxes to a configuration form.\nIn order to extend this form extension, your Symfony form type must implement a getParent() method returning MultistoreConfigurationType::class.\n\u0026lt;?php /** * {@inheritdoc} * * @see MultistoreConfigurationTypeExtension */ public function getParent(): string { return MultistoreConfigurationType::class; } Then for each form element that should have its multistore checkbox, you must add a multistore_configuration_key option, with the configuration key to which it should be attached as a value:\n\u0026lt;?php class MyFormType extends TranslatorAwareType { /** * {@inheritdoc} */ public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options) { $builder -\u0026gt;add( \u0026#39;my_field\u0026#39;, SwitchType::class, [ \u0026#39;required\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, // Here we add the multistore_configuration_key option with the configuration key it is linked to.  \u0026#39;multistore_configuration_key\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;THE_CONFIGURATION_KEY\u0026#39;, // ...  ] ) // ...

Saving data from a multistore configuration form When receiving the data from the form, you will also receive values from the multistore checkboxes that were added to your form:\n When a multistore checkbox is pushed unchecked, we want to delete the configuration value for the current context (so that it inherits its value from parent contexts). When a multistore checkbox is pushed checked, we want to save the configuration value for the current context.  When your configuration form is multistore compatible, your configuration class should extend the AbstractMultistoreConfiguration abstract class instead of directly implementing the DataConfigurationInterface interface. This will give you access to helper methods that will make it easy to store the right configuration values at the right place and for the right context.\nThe two helper methods are\n getShopConstraint(): this will give you a ShopConstraint object reflecting the current context or null  public function getShopConstraint(): ?ShopConstraint  updateConfigurationValue(): this will save or delete the configuration value for the given configuration key, and is aware of the multistore checkbox and the current shop context.

	"content": "Translation tips and tricks Adding new wordings Wordings for the Core and Native modules can only be translated if they are declared in PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s default translation catalogue. Therefore, whenever a new wording is added to the core or to a native module, it must be added to the default catalogue as well.\nNormally you would have to manually add each wording the appropriate default catalogue files (located in the app/Resources/translations/default folder). Thankfully, this task has been automated by the Core team!\nBefore every minor release, the whole source code for PrestaShop and Native Modules is analyzed using TranslationToolsBundle, and all newly discovered wordings are automatically added to the default catalogue.\nIncidentally, the same technique is also used to detect wordings used by third-party modules and make them translatable through the Back Office interface. Making wordings discoverable for automated addition to the catalogue TranslationToolsBundle uses static analysis to extract wordings from source code. Therefore, this means that you can simply use new wordings in the code, and they will be magically added to the catalogue later.\nHowever, due to limitations of this technique, the following guidelines must be followed when declaring new wordings:\n  This tool only detects wordings used through the trans() function, the {l} Smarty tag, and the trans Twig filter. Therefore, they must be declared in a PHP, TPL, or TWIG file. They will be detected regardless of whether that code is actually used in runtime or not.\n  Always use literal values, not variables, with the trans() function, the {l} Smarty tag, and trans Twig filter.

	"content": "Translation tips and tricks Adding new wordings Wordings for the Core and Native modules can only be translated if they are declared in PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s default translation catalogue. Therefore, whenever a new wording is added to the core or to a native module, it must be added to the default catalogue as well.\nNormally you would have to manually add each wording the appropriate default catalogue files (located in the app/Resources/translations/default folder). Thankfully, this task has been automated by the Core team!\nBefore every minor release, the whole source code for PrestaShop and Native Modules is analyzed using TranslationToolsBundle, and all newly discovered wordings are automatically added to the default catalogue.\nIncidentally, the same technique is also used to detect wordings used by third-party modules and make them translatable through the Back Office interface. Making wordings discoverable for automated addition to the catalogue TranslationToolsBundle uses static analysis to extract wordings from source code. Therefore, this means that you can simply use new wordings in the code, and they will be magically added to the catalogue later.\nHowever, due to limitations of this technique, the following guidelines must be followed when declaring new wordings:\n  This tool only detects wordings used through the trans() function, the {l} Smarty tag, and the trans Twig filter. Therefore, they must be declared in a PHP, TPL, or TWIG file. They will be detected regardless of whether that code is actually used in runtime or not.\n  Always use literal values, not variables, with the trans() function, the {l} Smarty tag, and trans Twig filter. Although variables are interpolated at runtime, they won\u0026rsquo;t be understood by the code analyzer, which only supports literals. Passing variables as arguments to these functions will prevent those wordings from being added to the catalogue.\n  Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in the wording not being added to the catalogue and not being translatable! Examples:\n\u0026lt;?php // literal values will work $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Admin.Catalog.Feature\u0026#39;); // dynamic content can be injected using placeholders \u0026amp; replacements $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some wording with %foo%\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;%foo%\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $dynamicContent], \u0026#39;Admin.Catalog.Feature\u0026#39;); // this won\u0026#39;t work, the interpreter will ignore variables $wording = \u0026#39;Some wording\u0026#39;; $domain = \u0026#39;Admin.Catalog.Feature\u0026#39;; $this-\u0026gt;trans($wording, [], $domain); // this will yield unexpected results $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Some \u0026#39;. $var . \u0026#39; wording\u0026#39;, [], \u0026#39;Admin.Catalog.Feature\u0026#39;); // dynamic behavior, like aliasing the trans() function, won\u0026#39;t work well either function translate($wording) { $this-\u0026gt;trans($wording, [], \u0026#39;Admin.Catalog.Feature\u0026#39;); } In Twig files, you can use trans_default_domain to set up your default domain.

This is pretty easy to use, when you are working on a directory which need an older or newer node version, use one of these tools to switch and then npm install \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm run build.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Validation The purpose of validation is to protect the application from failures, state inconsistency, security related issues etc. PrestaShop has few different levels of validation:\n Forms (the CRUD or Settings) - are using Symfony validation constraints to prevent the user from providing invalid information while also enriching the user experience. For example if a form input expects Yes or No, but user submitted value XYZ we want to reject the data and inform the user what was wrong. The best approach (if possible) is to prevent user providing the wrong value in the first place, so in this example we could simply use a checkbox or select input with only 2 possible selections. There are some custom constraints implemented in PrestaShop here. Value objects - after the form is submitted and validated, controller is usually dispatching some Command. We must ensure that commands are valid too, because in theory, commands should not be aware whether they were dispatched from a controller or from a command line, therefore it is possible that inputs are not yet validated by the form. The command itself should not handle the validation (although there are some older commands that does that, but that might only be some early migration mistakes), but use the value objects in the constructor instead. Value objects have their own validation rules and can be reused in any other command. For example, take a look at ProductCondition - this is a value object of Product domain. It allows constructing specific values and throws ProductConstraintException if invalid one is provided. It is currently used in UpdateProductOptionsCommand and helps to maintain the command validity. Domain services - after the command is constructed and dispatched, it reaches the CommandHandler, which calls all the needed Domain services (there are also lots of CommandHandlers that handles all the logic including the validation by themselves, but it is not recommended anymore and should be perceived as migration mistakes). Domain services can perform final checks (e.g. heavy sql queries to check certain records existence) before performing the write operations. Entities (or the ObjectModels in Prestashop) - This is the last level. It is there to prevent data integrity issues (like attempting to store a string into an integer column). This is something that, if all data validations before were done correctly, should rarely happen. This is the last step before data is being persisted: if invalid data has slipped through validation levels and passes this step, then it is persisted in database and might introduce inconsistency in the application. If these errors still occur, you might get a legacy PrestaShopException, but in recent migration process we try to catch it early and replace it by related CoreException or DomainException. See more in Domain services.  Sometimes it is worth introducing {SomeDomain}Settings class, which holds some simple validation constants like length or regex pattern. This is advised when field has only one validation rule, and it is not worth adding a dedicated Value object just for that. For example, see AddressSettings.\nIt is advised to replace the hardcoded values in related ObjectModel validation fields with such constants (same for value object constants - once we have a constant, we reuse it everywhere as a single source of truth).\n "

Unfortunately it also has limited extension capabilities - there are no common services as form or grid builders, therefore no hooks that could help module developers to modify the display.\nAll the javascript code related to this page can be found at admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/order/create.js. These .js files are the develop version prior compiling. See \u0026ldquo;How to compile assets\u0026rdquo; for more information. The flow Customer When you enter the page, first thing you will notice is the Customer block:  Customer search block   Use the search to find desired customer by email or name or create a new one by pressing Add new customer. Customer search is performed using ajax by calling CustomerController::searchAction. Javascript code can be found in customer-manager.js\nAdd new customer button opens the same form from Customers -\u0026gt; Customers -\u0026gt; Add new customer loaded in an iframe.

This block is loaded using ajax by calling CustomerController::getOrdersAction. Related javascript code can be found in customer-manager.js\nCart block  Cart   Cart block contains cart products, currency and language selection. Products can be searched and added to a cart. A list of products and a new block of Cart rules will appear after a product is added. Listed products quantity and price can be modified. Related actions addProductAction, editProductPriceAction and editProductQuantityAction can be found in CartController  Products list   Product price can be modified. This is similar behavior to the one in the Order view page, however behind the scenes it is different. Unlike in the Order view page, we don\u0026rsquo;t have any OrderDetail yet, because at this point we are still modifying the Cart, so it is achieved by creating a new temporary SpecificPrice and assigning specifically to that certain Cart, Product, Customer and Shop. See CartController::editProductPriceAction. Cart rules block  Vouchers   This block allows searching cart rules by name or code and adding them to the cart. Related actions can be found in CartRuleController::searchAction and CartController::addCartRuleAction It is also possible to create a new Cart rule by clicking the Add new voucher button.\nAdd new voucher button opens the same form from Sell -\u0026gt; Catalog -\u0026gt; Discounts -\u0026gt; Add new cart rule loaded in an iframe. Customer addresses block  Addresses   This block allows selecting the delivery and invoice addresses for the customer. New address can be created by clicking Add new address - the modal window with the creation form will appear. It is also possible to edit the addresses in same manner, by clicking Edit on selected address.\nThe form in the modal is actually the same form from Customers -\u0026gt; Addresses page rendered using an iframe. Shipping block  Shipping   Shipping block will appear only if at least one carrier is available for selected delivery address. This block allows selecting a carrier for the order, shows the shipping price and allows to mark the order as Free shipping.\nWhen Free shipping is checked, behind the scenes, it is achieved by creating a new temporary CartRule with $free_shipping = true and assigned to customer. See UpdateCartDeliverySettingsHandler::handleFreeShippingOption. Summary block  Order summary block   This is the final block that requires selecting payment method, order status and allows submitting the whole form. Prior to that it also allows adding a message for the customer or sending the email with the pre-filled order to the customer. Once Create the order is clicked it uses the OrderController::placeAction to create the order.\nYou can also click More actions -\u0026gt; Proceed to checkout in the front office to finish up the order in the Front office of your shop.

	"content": "Adding module links in the back-office side menu  On the PrestaShop back office, the links on the side menu are linked to AdminControllers and ModuleAdminController classes. The first ones come from the PrestaShop Core, but the second ones are defined by the modules. If you want to add a link to your ModuleAdminControllers in the back office sidebar, this guide is for you.\nTabs registration In order to register new links, open your main module class.\nWe will now use a property called $tabs, storing an array of link details. Each of them contains a class (= link) to add in the side menu.\nHow to define a tab in the menu Depending on the options you provide, your links won’t be displayed the same way:\n   Property Required Type Description Example     class_name Yes String Class called when the user will click on your link. This is the class name without the Controller part. \u0026quot;AdminGamification\u0026quot;   route_name No String  1.7.7  Symfony route name, if your controller is Symfony-based \u0026quot;gamification_configuration\u0026quot;   name No String|String[] Label displayed in the menu. If not provided, the class name is shown instead. \u0026quot;Merchant Expertise\u0026quot;   parent_class_name No String The parent menu, if you want to display it in a subcategory. Go farther in this document to see available values.    icon No String Icon name to use, if any \u0026quot;shopping_basket\u0026quot;   visible No Boolean Whether you want to display the tab or not. Hidden tabs are used when you don\u0026rsquo;t need a menu item but you still need to handle access rights. true   wording  No String  1.7.8  The translation key to use to translate the menu label. \u0026quot;Merchant Expertise\u0026quot;   wording_domain No String  1.7.8  The translation domain to use to translate the menu label. \u0026quot;Modules.Gamification.Admin\u0026quot;    How to specify the menu label By default, your tab will be displayed in the menu with its class name. If you want to use a different label, you can set the name property. This label can be translated in two ways.\nOption 1: Use the same label for all languages If you want to add the same name to all available and active languages available on the shop, just set the ‘name’ key with a single string:\n\u0026lt;?php class mymodule extends Module { public $tabs = [ [ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Merchant Expertise\u0026#39;, // One name for all langs  \u0026#39;class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminGamification\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;visible\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;parent_class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ShopParameters\u0026#39;, ], ]; // ... } Option 2: Use a different name for each language Since PrestaShop 1.7.8 Since 1.7.8  you can declare a wording and wording_domain to leverage the translation system. This will allow the menu to be translated automatically using either the provided translation catalogues or the translation interface.\n\u0026lt;?php class mymodule extends Module { public $tabs = [ [ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Merchant Expertise\u0026#39;, // Fallback when the translation is unavailable  \u0026#39;class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminGamification\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;parent_class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ShopParameters\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wording\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Merchant Expertise\u0026#39;, // Translation key  \u0026#39;wording_domain\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Modules.Gamification.Admin\u0026#39;, // Translation domain  ], ]; // ... } Alternative - declare your translations In previous PrestaShop versions, wording and wording_domain will be ignored. In that case, you will have to provide translations for every language upfront.\nYou can add your translations per locale (ex.: fr-FR) or per language (ex.: fr) – both are valid.\n\u0026lt;?php class mymodule extends Module { public $tabs = [ [ \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;en\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Merchant Expertise\u0026#39;, // Fallback value  \u0026#39;fr\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Expertise PrestaShop\u0026#39;, ... ], \u0026#39;class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminGamification\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;parent_class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ShopParameters\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wording\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Merchant Expertise\u0026#39;, // Ignored in PS \u0026lt; 1.7.8  \u0026#39;wording_domain\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Modules.Gamification.Admin\u0026#39;, // Ignored in PS \u0026lt; 1.7.8  ], ]; // ... }  Ordering is important. If the user\u0026rsquo;s language is not found in your translated names, the first value in the array will be used as fallback. Hence, we advise you to define the English value first. Which parent to choose? Here is the default structure of the side-menu from PrestaShop at the moment this page is written. You can choose an element from this list to use as a parent.\n AdminDashboard SELL  AdminParentOrders  AdminOrders AdminInvoices AdminSlip AdminDeliverySlip AdminCarts   AdminCatalog  AdminProducts  AdminCategories AdminTracking AdminParentAttributesGroups AdminParentManufacturers AdminAttachments AdminParentCartRules     AdminParentCustomer  AdminCustomers AdminAddresses AdminOutstanding   AdminParentCustomerThreads  AdminCustomerThreads AdminOrderMessage AdminReturn   AdminStats AdminStock  AdminWarehouses AdminParentStockManagement AdminSupplyOrders AdminStockConfiguration     IMPROVE  AdminParentModulesSf  AdminModulesSf AdminModules AdminAddonsCatalog   AdminParentThemes  AdminThemes AdminThemesCatalog AdminCmsContent AdminModulesPositions AdminImages   AdminParentShipping  AdminCarriers AdminShipping   AdminParentPayment  AdminPayment AdminPaymentPreferences   AdminInternational  AdminParentLocalization AdminParentCountries AdminParentTaxes AdminTranslations     CONFIGURE  ShopParameters  AdminParentPreferences AdminParentOrderPreferences AdminPPreferences AdminParentCustomerPreferences AdminParentStores AdminParentMeta AdminParentSearchConf   AdminAdvancedParameters  AdminInformation AdminPerformance AdminAdminPreferences AdminEmails AdminImport AdminParentEmployees AdminParentRequestSql AdminLogs AdminWebservice AdminShopGroup AdminShopUrl     DEFAULT  How to check the tabs registration Once you\u0026rsquo;re done, just install (or reset) your module.\nThe $tabs property will be read from PrestaShop and the tabs will be automatically displayed on the side menu. They will stay as long as your module is installed.\nTab permissions, accesses and roles When you create a new Tab it automatically creates the appropriate roles in Tab::initAccess based on the class_name. For example using AdminLinkWidget as the class name will create the following roles:\n ROLE_MOD_TAB_ADMINLINKWIDGET_CREATE ROLE_MOD_TAB_ADMINLINKWIDGET_DELETE ROLE_MOD_TAB_ADMINLINKWIDGET_READ ROLE_MOD_TAB_ADMINLINKWIDGET_UPDATE  These roles will allow you to manage detailed permission in your controllers, you can read this documentation if you need more details about Controller Security. They are automatically added to the SUPER_ADMIN group, and the group of the Employee installing the module, but you can then edit privileges for other Employee groups.\nHidden Tabs\nTabs are usually visible and accessible in the menu, but there are also invisible tabs, they are only created for permissions to manage Security. All the controllers present in controllers/admin in your module are automatically added as hidden Tabs (if no visible Tab exists).\n Automatic hiding of disabled modules  When you disable a module, all its related Tabs will be automatically hidden from the Back Office menu.\nTabs are kept in database with their enabled field is set to false. Once the module is enabled again all its Tabs are automatically enabled as well.\nModern Controllers Manual tab insertion  If you created a modern controller using Symfony controllers and routing you can\u0026rsquo;t create a Tab as is because the system is based on legacy controllers identified through their class names. But you can still trick it using the _legacy_link property in the routing (more details about this feature in the Controller and Routing page).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume you already defined your Symfony route:\n# modules/your-module/config/routes.ymlyour_route_name:path:your-module/demomethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;MyModule\\Controller\\DemoController::demoAction\u0026#39;What you need to do then is add the _legacy_controller and _legacy_link parameters:\n# modules/your-module/config/routes.ymlyour_route_name:path:your-module/demomethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;MyModule\\Controller\\DemoController::demoAction\u0026#39;_legacy_controller:\u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;_legacy_link:\u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;So now any call in the menu system to Link::getAdminLink('MyModuleDemoController')' will return your controller url your-module/demo But since the MyModuleDemoController class actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the automatic tab registration based on the $tabs property won\u0026rsquo;t work. So you need to insert your tab manually during your module installation:\n\u0026lt;?php use Language; class Example_module_mailtheme extends Module { public function install() { return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;installTab() ; } public function uninstall() { return parent::uninstall() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;uninstallTab() ; } public function enable($force_all = false) { return parent::enable($force_all) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;installTab() ; } public function disable($force_all = false) { return parent::disable($force_all) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;uninstallTab() ; } private function installTab() { $tabId = (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName(\u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;); if (!$tabId) { $tabId = null; } $tab = new Tab($tabId); $tab-\u0026gt;active = 1; $tab-\u0026gt;class_name = \u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;; // Only since 1.7.7, you can define a route name  $tab-\u0026gt;route_name = \u0026#39;admin_my_symfony_routing\u0026#39;; $tab-\u0026gt;name = array(); foreach (Language::getLanguages() as $lang) { $tab-\u0026gt;name[$lang[\u0026#39;id_lang\u0026#39;]] = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My Module Demo\u0026#39;, array(), \u0026#39;Modules.MyModule.Admin\u0026#39;, $lang[\u0026#39;locale\u0026#39;]); } $tab-\u0026gt;id_parent = (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName(\u0026#39;ShopParameters\u0026#39;); $tab-\u0026gt;module = $this-\u0026gt;name; return $tab-\u0026gt;save(); } private function uninstallTab() { $tabId = (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName(\u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;); if (!$tabId) { return true; } $tab = new Tab($tabId); return $tab-\u0026gt;delete(); } } And now you have your menu link directing to your Symfony controller with a nice url.\nAutomatic tab registration  Modern controllers can also be registered via the $tabs property. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to manually create the Tab object in this case, and you can take full advantage of the Symfony routing (no need for _legacy_link).\nHere is an example with a Symfony controller (example comes from the ps_linklist module). Nothing specific in this controller but notice the security annotation @AdminSecurity that uses request.get('_legacy_controller') which will make the link between this controller and the routing configuration.\n\u0026lt;?php // yourmodule/src/Controller/Admin/Improve/Design  namespace PrestaShop\\Module\\LinkList\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design; use PrestaShopBundle\\Security\\Annotation\\AdminSecurity; // (...)  /** * Class LinkBlockController. * * @ModuleActivated(moduleName=\u0026#34;ps_linklist\u0026#34;, redirectRoute=\u0026#34;admin_module_manage\u0026#34;) */ class LinkBlockController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { /** * @AdminSecurity(\u0026#34;is_granted(\u0026#39;read\u0026#39;, request.get(\u0026#39;_legacy_controller\u0026#39;))\u0026#34;, message=\u0026#34;Access denied.\u0026#34;) * * @param Request $request * * @return Response */ public function listAction(Request $request) { // (...)  } } Now here is the routing configuration. We can see the _legacy_controller option is present with a value of AdminLinkWidget. This will be used for the AdminSecurity annotation, but also as our Tab\u0026rsquo;s class_name.\n# yourmodule/config/routes.ymladmin_link_block_list:path:/link-widget/listmethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\Module\\LinkList\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\LinkBlockController::listAction\u0026#39;# _legacy_controller is used to manage permissions_legacy_controller:AdminLinkWidget# No need for _legacy_link in this caseFinally, here is the $tabs property used for automatic registration. It still requires a class_name field: it will be used to create the default AUTHORIZATION_ROLES related to this class_name, and later to check for those permissions.\n\u0026lt;?php // yourmodule/ps_linklist.php use Language; class Ps_Linklist extends Module { public function __construct() { // ...  $tabNames = []; foreach (Language::getLanguages(true) as $lang) { $tabNames[$lang[\u0026#39;locale\u0026#39;]] = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Link List\u0026#39;, array(), \u0026#39;Modules.Linklist.Admin\u0026#39;, $lang[\u0026#39;locale\u0026#39;]); } $this-\u0026gt;tabs = [ [ \u0026#39;route_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_link_block_list\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminLinkWidget\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;visible\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $tabNames, \u0026#39;parent_class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminParentThemes\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wording\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Link List\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wording_domain\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Modules.Linklist.Admin\u0026#39; ], ]; // ...  } }  Hidden Tabs\nSince 1.7.7, when you create a Symfony route with the _legacy_controller if no visible Tab has been created an invisible one is automatically created so the permissions will be correctly handled.\n "

So you need to insert your tab manually during your module installation:\n\u0026lt;?php use Language; class Example_module_mailtheme extends Module { public function install() { return parent::install() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;installTab() ; } public function uninstall() { return parent::uninstall() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;uninstallTab() ; } public function enable($force_all = false) { return parent::enable($force_all) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;installTab() ; } public function disable($force_all = false) { return parent::disable($force_all) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;uninstallTab() ; } private function installTab() { $tabId = (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName(\u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;); if (!$tabId) { $tabId = null; } $tab = new Tab($tabId); $tab-\u0026gt;active = 1; $tab-\u0026gt;class_name = \u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;; // Only since 1.7.7, you can define a route name  $tab-\u0026gt;route_name = \u0026#39;admin_my_symfony_routing\u0026#39;; $tab-\u0026gt;name = array(); foreach (Language::getLanguages() as $lang) { $tab-\u0026gt;name[$lang[\u0026#39;id_lang\u0026#39;]] = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;My Module Demo\u0026#39;, array(), \u0026#39;Modules.MyModule.Admin\u0026#39;, $lang[\u0026#39;locale\u0026#39;]); } $tab-\u0026gt;id_parent = (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName(\u0026#39;ShopParameters\u0026#39;); $tab-\u0026gt;module = $this-\u0026gt;name; return $tab-\u0026gt;save(); } private function uninstallTab() { $tabId = (int) Tab::getIdFromClassName(\u0026#39;MyModuleDemoController\u0026#39;); if (!$tabId) { return true; } $tab = new Tab($tabId); return $tab-\u0026gt;delete(); } } And now you have your menu link directing to your Symfony controller with a nice url.\nAutomatic tab registration  Modern controllers can also be registered via the $tabs property. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to manually create the Tab object in this case, and you can take full advantage of the Symfony routing (no need for _legacy_link).\nHere is an example with a Symfony controller (example comes from the ps_linklist module). Nothing specific in this controller but notice the security annotation @AdminSecurity that uses request.get('_legacy_controller') which will make the link between this controller and the routing configuration.\n\u0026lt;?php // yourmodule/src/Controller/Admin/Improve/Design  namespace PrestaShop\\Module\\LinkList\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design; use PrestaShopBundle\\Security\\Annotation\\AdminSecurity; // (...)  /** * Class LinkBlockController. * * @ModuleActivated(moduleName=\u0026#34;ps_linklist\u0026#34;, redirectRoute=\u0026#34;admin_module_manage\u0026#34;) */ class LinkBlockController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { /** * @AdminSecurity(\u0026#34;is_granted(\u0026#39;read\u0026#39;, request.get(\u0026#39;_legacy_controller\u0026#39;))\u0026#34;, message=\u0026#34;Access denied.\u0026#34;) * * @param Request $request * * @return Response */ public function listAction(Request $request) { // (...)  } } Now here is the routing configuration. We can see the _legacy_controller option is present with a value of AdminLinkWidget. This will be used for the AdminSecurity annotation, but also as our Tab\u0026rsquo;s class_name.\n# yourmodule/config/routes.ymladmin_link_block_list:path:/link-widget/listmethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\Module\\LinkList\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\LinkBlockController::listAction\u0026#39;# _legacy_controller is used to manage permissions_legacy_controller:AdminLinkWidget# No need for _legacy_link in this caseFinally, here is the $tabs property used for automatic registration. It still requires a class_name field: it will be used to create the default AUTHORIZATION_ROLES related to this class_name, and later to check for those permissions.\n\u0026lt;?php // yourmodule/ps_linklist.php use Language; class Ps_Linklist extends Module { public function __construct() { // ...  $tabNames = []; foreach (Language::getLanguages(true) as $lang) { $tabNames[$lang[\u0026#39;locale\u0026#39;]] = $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Link List\u0026#39;, array(), \u0026#39;Modules.Linklist.Admin\u0026#39;, $lang[\u0026#39;locale\u0026#39;]); } $this-\u0026gt;tabs = [ [ \u0026#39;route_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;admin_link_block_list\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminLinkWidget\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;visible\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $tabNames, \u0026#39;parent_class_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;AdminParentThemes\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wording\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Link List\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wording_domain\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Modules.Linklist.Admin\u0026#39; ], ]; // ...  } }  Hidden Tabs\nSince 1.7.7, when you create a Symfony route with the _legacy_controller if no visible Tab has been created an invisible one is automatically created so the permissions will be correctly handled.\n "

	"content": "Asset Management PrestaShop 1.7 has significantly improved the way assets (CSS, JavaScript and image files) are managed.\nWe advise theme developers to compile most of their style and JavaScript code into a single concatenated/minified file (see the Webpack section below).\nIf you need to add special assets, for example an extra JavaScript library on the home page or the product page, there are a few ways to do so.\nYour theme have to print assets correctly in the smarty template, and it\u0026rsquo;s explained in the template section.\nRegistering assets In PrestaShop 1.7+, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to register custom assets on each pages. The major improvement is that you can easily manage them from your theme, without any modules.\nWe introduced new methods to register assets, and especially new cool options.\nFor instance, you can register your asset specifically in the head or bottom of your HTML code; you can load it with attributes like async or defer; and you can even inline it easily.\nOne favorite option is the priority one, which makes it very easy to ensure everything is loaded in the order you need.\nBackward compatibility is kept for the addJS(), addCSS(), addJqueryUI() and addJqueryPlugin() methods. Incidentally, now is the best time to update your libraries and use the new method. Here is a list of options, and what they do.\nOptions PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s FrontController class provides 2 new methods to easily register new assets: registerStylesheet() and registerJavascript().\nIn order to have the most extensible signatures, these 2 methods take 3 arguments. The first one is the unique ID of the asset, the second one is the relative path, and the third one is an array of all other optional parameters, as described below.\nID\nThis unique identifier needed for each asset. Reusing the same ID is useful to either override or unregister something already loaded by the Core or a native module.\nHowever, avoid generic names when adding new JS and CSS files to avoid collision with other extensions. Prefixing with your module or theme name is a good start.\nRelative path\nThis is the path of your asset. In order to make your assets fully overridable and compatible with the parent/child feature, you need to provide the path from the theme\u0026rsquo;s root directory, or PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s root directory if it\u0026rsquo;s a module.\nFor example:\n \u0026lsquo;assets/css/example.css\u0026rsquo; for something in your theme. \u0026lsquo;modules/modulename/css/example.css\u0026rsquo; for something in your module.  Extra parameters for stylesheet\n  Name Values Comment  media all | braille | embossed | handheld | print | projection | screen | speech | tty | tv (default: all) -  priority 0-999 (default: 50) 0 is the highest priority  inline true | false (default: false) If true, your style will be printed inside the \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; tag in your HTML \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;. Use with caution.    Extra parameters for JavaScript\n  Name Values Comment  position head | bottom (default: bottom) JavaScript files should be loaded in the bottom as much as possible. Remember: core.js is loaded first thing in the bottom so jQuery won't be loaded in the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; part.  priority 0-999 (default: 50) 0 is the highest priority  inline true | false (default: false) If true, your JavaScript will be printed inside \u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;text/javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt; tags inside your HTML. Use with caution.  attributes async | defer | none (default: none) Load JavaScript file with the corresponding attribute (Read more: Async vs Defer attributes)  server local | remote (default: local) Define if the JS resource is a local or remote path    Registered by the Core Every page of every theme loads the following files:\n theme.css custom.css rtl.css (if a right-to-left language is detected) core.js theme.js custom.js    Filename ID Priority Comment  theme.css theme-main 50 Most (all?) of your theme's styles. Should be minified.  rtl.css theme-rtl 900 Loaded only for Right-To-Left language  custom.css theme-custom 1000 Empty file loaded at the very end to allow user to override some simple style.  core.js corejs 0 Provided by PrestaShop. Contains jQuery3, dispatches PrestaShop events and holds PrestaShop logic.  theme.js theme-main 50  Most of your theme's JavaScript. Should embed libraries required on all pages, and be minified.\n   custom.js theme-custom 1000 Empty file loaded at the very end, to allow user to override behavior or add simple script.    Registering in themes By now you probably understood that this theme.yml file became the heart of PrestaShop themes.\nTo register assets, create a new assets key at the top level of your theme.yml, and register your files according to your needs. Page identifiers are based on the php_self property of each controller (example)\nFor example, if you want to add an external library on each page and a custom library on the Product page:\nassets:css:product:- id:product-extra-stylepath:assets/css/product.cssmedia:allpriority:100js:all:- id:this-cool-libpath:assets/js/external-lib.jspriority:30position:bottomproduct:- id:product-custom-libpath:assets/js/product.jspriority:200attribute:asyncIn addition, if you want to include a library hosted in a different server you can use the following syntax:\nassets:css:all:- id:custom-cdn-csspath://cdn-url.com/external-lib.cssmedia:allpriority:200server:remotejs:all:- id:custom-cdn-jspath://cdn-url.com/external-lib.jspriority:200server:remoteRegistering in modules When developing a PrestaShop module, you may want to add specific styles for your templates. The best way is to use the registerStylesheet and registerJavascript methods provided by the parent FrontController class.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re developing a custom module that only works on your themes, don\u0026rsquo;t put any style or JavaScript code inside the module: put it in the theme\u0026rsquo;s files instead (theme.js and theme.css). With a front controller module If you develop a front controller, simply extend the setMedia() method. For instance:\n\u0026lt;?php public function setMedia() { parent::setMedia(); if (\u0026#39;product\u0026#39; === $this-\u0026gt;php_self) { $this-\u0026gt;registerStylesheet( \u0026#39;module-modulename-style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;modules/\u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;name.\u0026#39;/css/modulename.css\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;media\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;all\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 200, ] ); $this-\u0026gt;registerJavascript( \u0026#39;module-modulename-simple-lib\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;modules/\u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;module-\u0026gt;name.\u0026#39;/js/lib/simple-lib.js\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 200, \u0026#39;attribute\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;async\u0026#39;, ] ); } } Without a front controller module If you only have your module\u0026rsquo;s class, register your code on the actionFrontControllerSetMedia hook, and add your asset on the go inside the hook:\n\u0026lt;?php public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia($params) { // Only on product page  if (\u0026#39;product\u0026#39; === $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;php_self) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerStylesheet( \u0026#39;module-modulename-style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;modules/\u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;name.\u0026#39;/css/modulename.css\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;media\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;all\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 200, ] ); $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerJavascript( \u0026#39;module-modulename-simple-lib\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;modules/\u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;name.\u0026#39;/js/lib/simple-lib.js\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 200, \u0026#39;attribute\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;async\u0026#39;, ] ); } // On every pages  $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;registerJavascript( \u0026#39;google-analytics\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;modules/\u0026#39;.$this-\u0026gt;name.\u0026#39;/ga.js\u0026#39;, [ \u0026#39;position\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;head\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;inline\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 10, ] ); } Unregistering You can unregister assets! That\u0026rsquo;s the whole point of an id. For example if you want to improve your theme/module\u0026rsquo;s compatibility with a module, you can unregister its assets and handle them yourself.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you want to be fully compatible with a popular navigation module. You could create a template override of course, but you could also remove the style that comes with it and bundle your specific style in your theme.css (since it\u0026rsquo;s loaded on every page).\nTo unregister an assets, you need to know its ID.\nIn themes As of today, the only way to unregister an asset without any module is to place an empty file where the module override would be.\nIf the module registers a JavaScript file placed in views/js/file.js, you simply need to create an empty file in modules/modulename/views/js/file.js.\nIt works for both JavaScript and CSS assets.\nIn modules Both unregisterJavascript and unregisterStylesheet methods take only one argument: the unique ID of the resource you want to remove.\n\u0026lt;?php // In a front controller public function setMedia() { parent::setMedia(); $this-\u0026gt;unregisterJavascript(\u0026#39;the-identifier\u0026#39;); } // In a module class public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia($params) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;unregisterJavascript(\u0026#39;the-identifier\u0026#39;); } "

You could create a template override of course, but you could also remove the style that comes with it and bundle your specific style in your theme.css (since it\u0026rsquo;s loaded on every page).\nTo unregister an assets, you need to know its ID.\nIn themes As of today, the only way to unregister an asset without any module is to place an empty file where the module override would be.\nIf the module registers a JavaScript file placed in views/js/file.js, you simply need to create an empty file in modules/modulename/views/js/file.js.\nIt works for both JavaScript and CSS assets.\nIn modules Both unregisterJavascript and unregisterStylesheet methods take only one argument: the unique ID of the resource you want to remove.\n\u0026lt;?php // In a front controller public function setMedia() { parent::setMedia(); $this-\u0026gt;unregisterJavascript(\u0026#39;the-identifier\u0026#39;); } // In a module class public function hookActionFrontControllerSetMedia($params) { $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;unregisterJavascript(\u0026#39;the-identifier\u0026#39;); } "

To overcome this, the Pull Request #21435 introduced new hooks in AdminController::init() as well as in other abstract Controller classes:\n actionFrontControllerInitBefore actionFrontControllerInitAfter actionAdminControllerInitBefore actionAdminControllerInitAfter actionControllerInitAfter actionControllerInitBefore  The hook actionFrontControllerAfterInit has been removed (an alias is still there to avoid BC break).\nDatabase table charset updated All database tables have been switched to the utf8mb4 charset in order to provide support for emojis.\nBecause of this, the size for some indexes have been reduced to 191:\n Field alias in alias table Field slug in authorization_role table Field module in module_preference table Field module in tab_module_preference table Field cache_id in smarty_lazy_cache table  Updated jQuery to latest version jQuery has been updated to 3.4.1 in Back office (up from 1.11 in legacy pages) and Core theme (up from 2.1.4).\njQuery has changed a lot between v1.11 / v2.1.4 and v3.4.1. This is why jquery migrate was enabled in order to provide a layer of compatibility, but this does not preserve all jQuery capabilities for such old versions.\nModules relying on these old capabilities may experience problems, including but not limited to:\n context property has been removed Using dataType in an ajax request won\u0026rsquo;t trigger the success / done methods if the type of content returned does not match jQuery.attr() behavior has evolved, most of the time, you should use jQuery.prop() instead.  Order view page layout modifications In this version the order page has been migrated with Symfony. We used this migration as an opportunity to improve the page layout to meet the merchants' needs. You can see a representation of these new hooks in the page here:\n Order view page hooks layout   Modified hooks The following hooks have been moved and have new names. Even though they are very similar to their former equivalents the layout has changed and thus the modules need to adapt their rendering.\n   Removed hook New hook Modification     displayAdminOrderRight displayAdminOrderSideBottom It is now displayed on the left which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position, since the layout is completely different it has no alias   displayAdminOrderLeft displayAdminOrderMainBottom It is now displayed on the right which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position, since the layout is completely different it has no alias   displayAdminOrderTabOrder and displayAdminOrderTabShip displayAdminOrderTabLink Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab links the order view page, it only has the id_order as a parameter   displayAdminOrderContentOrder and displayAdminOrderContentShip displayAdminOrderTabContent Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab contents the order view page, it only has the id_order as a parameter    These hooks have been aliased, although we recommend migrating to the new hooks and check that it integrates correctly with the new layout:\n   Deprecated hook New aliased hook Modification     displayBackOfficeOrderActions displayAdminOrderSide Although it has been aliased for convenience, the new hook is not displayed at the same place at all (it is now in the side column), so we suggest to verify how your code integrates into the new layout. If you need to add action buttons, use the new actionGetAdminOrderButtons hook   displayInvoice displayAdminOrderTop This hook has the same placement and parameters    These hooks have been added on the order view page:\n   New hook Function     displayAdminOrderSide It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderSideBottom) but right under the customer view   displayAdminOrderMain It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderMainBottom) but right under the details view   actionGetAdminOrderButtons It is used to build a collection of buttons in the order thanks to an ActionsBarButtonsCollection which is automatically rendered    These hooks have been added on the order list page:\n   New hook Function     displayOrderPreview It is displayed at the bottom of the order\u0026rsquo;s preview on the order\u0026rsquo;s listing page.    Product cover A major bug has been fixed in product listing, for products with combinations the image displayed was the first one from the default combination, and the cover was ignored. This behaviour has been fixed but in order to allow modules to override this cover a new cover_image_id has been introduced. This image ID is then used to populate the product.cover field usable in the templates, if you want the default image for the combination (which was the previous behaviour) you can use the new product.default_image field.\nIf your theme overrides some of the classic theme templates and uses the $product.cover property you should check that it still matches the expected behaviour, especially in the themes/classic/templates/catalog/_partials/product-cover-thumbnails.tpl used in the product page where $product.default_image should be used. You can read this FAQ if you want to know how to override the Product cover. Product - quick view mode In previous 1.7 versions if you wanted to check whether people are displaying product page using quick view, in a module hooked into displayProductAdditionalInfo, you could use this code:\n$quickView = (Tools::getValue('action') == 'quickview)\nFrom v1.7.7 due to changes related to dynamic refresh of displayProductAdditionalInfo in quick view modal, it\u0026rsquo;s no longer possible to do that this way.\nFrom now on, you can always ask ProductController to tell you if customer is using quick view, using this code:\nif ($this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller instanceof ProductController \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $this-\u0026gt;context-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;isQuickView()) { // We\u0026#39;re in quick view mode } or directly in .tpl file:\n{if $page.page_name == \u0026#39;product\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Context::getContext()-\u0026gt;controller-\u0026gt;isQuickView()}We\u0026#39;re in quick view mode for {$product.id_product}and attribute {$product.id_product_attribute}{/if}Modern Tabs for modern modules Modern modules that use Symfony controller and routing can now use the $tabs property in their module class to automatically register Tabs in the BackOffice menu.\nAlso new in this version, when a module is enabled/disabled all its related Tab links are automatically shown/hidden.\nDefault mail method does not use the mail() function anymore The mail() function is not used anymore for security reasons. Instead, /usr/sbin/sendmail is now the default way of sending mails. You should check that your server environment is configured to allow this use or change this setting in Configure \u0026gt; Advanced Parameters \u0026gt; E-mail by another sending method like SMTP. Other changes  CLDR Specification\\Number is now immutable Configuration forms have been split up for security reasons New alias for webpack namespace app -\u0026gt; @app The clickable_row option on Grids' LinkRowAction now uses .clickable as a selector, modules that rely on this feature should make sure that their templates use the appropriate class CLDR data has been updated to v36 Smarty has been updated to v3.1.34  "

	"content": "Configuration storage service The Configuration storage of PrestaShop aims to address two needs.\nFirst, there are multiple situations where a single value has to be stored and be available easily. It can be a boolean to control order mode, it can be a limit for timeout: a simple key =\u0026gt; value(s) storage is needed to manage multiple settings in PrestaShop.\nSecondly, modules might sometimes need a simple storage system, and they should not have to create a new SQL table for such a simple need.\nTo address these needs, the Configuration storage of PrestaShop uses a SQL table ps_configuration and allows simple fetch, update and deletion of values in it.\n Configuration SQL structure   Each value stored in the Configuration component can be controlled through a given key, is compatible with Multishop (as it can be overridden for a shop or a group of shops) and has timestamps.\nThe storage is managed by the Configuration class.\nUsage Accessing the component We recommend using the prestashop.adapter.legacy.configuration service to access configuration.\nIf you need backward compatibility with versions prior to 1.7 or if you find yourself unable to access the service for any reason, you can use the legacy Configuration class. Store configuration data $configuration-\u0026gt;set(string $key, mixed $value, ShopConstraint $shopConstraint = null): bool This method returns true if the operation is successful, false otherwise.\nParameters  $key Identifier to your data to reuse later. You can use any valid string, but by convention, identifiers are usually in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES. $value Value to store. It can be any scalar type (int, float, string, bool). Note: All values are stored as strings in database, so you might encounter type conversion issues if you save anything other than a string.\nUse of arrays to store multi language values.\nTo store a value in multiple languages, You can provide an array indexed by language id:\n[ 123 =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Value in some language\u0026#39;, 456 =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Value in some other language\u0026#39;, ] Note that this is the only supported use of arrays.\n  $shopConstraint 1.7.7   This optional parameter lets you specify the shop context for the operation (read the \u0026ldquo;Multistore\u0026rdquo; section below for more). If not provided, the behavior will depend on the global shop context. To avoid unpredictable behavior in Multistore contexts, we recommend setting this parameter.\n  Check if a configuration data set exists $configuration-\u0026gt;has(string $key, ShopConstraint $shopConstraint = null): bool This method returns true if the data exists, false otherwise.\nParameters  $key Identifier to check. $shopConstraint 1.7.7   This optional parameter lets you specify the shop context for the operation (read the \u0026ldquo;Multistore\u0026rdquo; section below for more). If not provided or set to \u0026ldquo;all shops\u0026rdquo;, this method to checks if the identifier exists for any shop.\n  Retrieve configuration data $configuration-\u0026gt;get(string $key, mixed $default = null): mixed This method returns the data for $key if it data exists, or NULL otherwise.\nIf the data is stored as multi language, this will return an array of values indexed by language id.\nParameters:\n $key Identifier to retrieve. $default 1.7.4   This optional parameter lets you define the value to return if the identifier is not found.  Delete configuration $configuration-\u0026gt;remove(string $key): void This method returns nothing, and throws an Exception on error.\nParameters:\n $key Identifier to delete. Note that this method deletes the value for all shops.  Multistore  By default, and unless otherwise specified, the methods described above work within the confines of the current store context, whether PrestaShop is using the multistore feature or not.\nHowever, it is possible to work outside of the current context and impact configurations for all shops, a shop group or a single, specific shop. This is done using the ShopConstraint parameter:\n ShopConstraint::shopId($shopId) will impact only the specified shop id. ShopConstraint::shopGroup($shopGroupId) will impact all shops within that shop group id. ShopConstraint::allShops() will impact all shops.  Example:\n// set a value for shop 12 only $configuration-\u0026gt;set( \u0026#39;SOME_SETTING\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;some value\u0026#39;, ShopConstraint::shopId(12) ); "

	"content": "Good practices for developing modules DOs and DON\u0026rsquo;Ts Do  Add a link to your documentation included in your ZIP File and to your support page on Addons in the module interface. Follow our Coding Standards Create your own database tables, do not alter PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s. Develop your module in English, then use PrestaShop translation system to translate your module. Go through directories using PrestaShop constants like: _PS_CONFIG_DIR_ . '/config.inc.php' CREATE TABLE SQL statements must be followed by IF NOT EXISTS to avoid SQL errors DROP TABLE SQL statements must be followed by IF EXISTS to avoid SQL errors  Don\u0026rsquo;t  Don\u0026rsquo;t insert external links into your module code or module documentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t provide your personal contact details in your module or module documentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t send your customers to your own support/ticket management platform. Don\u0026rsquo;t use external ajax files to perform ajax tasks. Don\u0026rsquo;t go through directories using code and variables like: dirname(__FILE__).'/../../config/config.inc.php' Don\u0026rsquo;t edit the SQL structure of PrestaShop tables. Don\u0026rsquo;t obfuscate your code, making it not human readable.  A few recommendations for your modules   Prefix what belongs to you:\n modules configuration parameters (ps_configuration) Smarty variables tables CSS classes    Consider deleting your configurations, tables, admin tabs, and all other entities unique to your product during the uninstallation of your modules.\n  You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use HTML code in your PHP code. Here are alternatives to separate the view into your code:\n display content with Smarty use helpers for your configuration pages include PrestUI, a graphic library created by the community for your configuration pages.    We recommend you to make your module interface matches the PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s UI kit.\n  For modules compatible before the 1.7 PrestaShop version, the minimal compatibility has to be PHP 5.3. You will be then able to use, for example, namespaces.\n  If your module allows the upload of a file, check the type of the file to make sure you avoid security issues. Here are more information for the function mime_content_type().\n  When your module has forms, you should:\n show a confirmation message if everything went fine or an error message if it did not. make sure information entered by customers are correct. If you ask a sum, it has to be only numbers. More information about the Validate class of PrestaShop here.    Consider carefully casting your variables and use pSQL/bqSQL in the SQL requests to avoid any injections (read Best Practices of the Db Class). Make sure your files are properly protected (especially if your module uses a cron for example) to avoid anyone being able to execute them. As a result, you are required to use a token!\n  The use of overrides is permitted, however if we decide that too many (2 / 3 max) have been used and/or the modifications are too dangerous, we will refuse your module.

	"content": "Good practices for developing modules DOs and DON\u0026rsquo;Ts Do  Add a link to your documentation included in your ZIP File and to your support page on Addons in the module interface. Follow our Coding Standards Create your own database tables, do not alter PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s. Develop your module in English, then use PrestaShop translation system to translate your module. Go through directories using PrestaShop constants like: _PS_CONFIG_DIR_ . '/config.inc.php' CREATE TABLE SQL statements must be followed by IF NOT EXISTS to avoid SQL errors DROP TABLE SQL statements must be followed by IF EXISTS to avoid SQL errors  Don\u0026rsquo;t  Don\u0026rsquo;t insert external links into your module code or module documentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t provide your personal contact details in your module or module documentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t send your customers to your own support/ticket management platform. Don\u0026rsquo;t use external ajax files to perform ajax tasks. Don\u0026rsquo;t go through directories using code and variables like: dirname(__FILE__).'/../../config/config.inc.php' Don\u0026rsquo;t edit the SQL structure of PrestaShop tables. Don\u0026rsquo;t obfuscate your code, making it not human readable.  A few recommendations for your modules   Prefix what belongs to you:\n modules configuration parameters (ps_configuration) Smarty variables tables CSS classes    Consider deleting your configurations, tables, admin tabs, and all other entities unique to your product during the uninstallation of your modules.\n  You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use HTML code in your PHP code. Here are alternatives to separate the view into your code:\n display content with Smarty use helpers for your configuration pages include PrestUI, a graphic library created by the community for your configuration pages.    We recommend you to make your module interface matches the PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s UI kit.\n  For modules compatible before the 1.7 PrestaShop version, the minimal compatibility has to be PHP 5.3. You will be then able to use, for example, namespaces.\n  If your module allows the upload of a file, check the type of the file to make sure you avoid security issues. Here are more information for the function mime_content_type().\n  When your module has forms, you should:\n show a confirmation message if everything went fine or an error message if it did not. make sure information entered by customers are correct. If you ask a sum, it has to be only numbers. More information about the Validate class of PrestaShop here.    Consider carefully casting your variables and use pSQL/bqSQL in the SQL requests to avoid any injections (read Best Practices of the Db Class). Make sure your files are properly protected (especially if your module uses a cron for example) to avoid anyone being able to execute them. As a result, you are required to use a token!\n  The use of overrides is permitted, however if we decide that too many (2 / 3 max) have been used and/or the modifications are too dangerous, we will refuse your module. If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch.\n  If you need to load a .js or .tpl (containing JavaScript) to the backoffice, put restrictions in place on your hooks (hookbackofficeheader/top/footer)! Specific examples: if your JS only applies to your module\u0026rsquo;s configuration page, use:\n\u0026lt;?php if (Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;configure\u0026#39;) === $this-\u0026gt;name) { // code }   A merchant is likely to have a shop running on a different shop than yours.

Set to false to avoid injecting scripts again when displaying more than one form in a single page. $id: string Value for the ID field (see $identifier below). $identifier: string Name of the ID field in the table where data is stored, if applicable. If present, a hidden field named the same as this variable will be added, and its value will be set to the $id attribute. $languages: array List of active languages, indexed by id_lang. You can usually get this from AdminController::getLanguages().\nThe expected structure is: array\u0026lt;int, array{id_lang: int, iso_code: string, is_default: bool, name: string}\u0026gt;. $module: Module Instance of the module using this form. This is only needed to allow the module to override the form\u0026rsquo;s template. $name_controller: string If set, this will:  Add a class of the same name to the \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; tag. Execute a hook named display\u0026lt;$name_controller\u0026gt;Form at the bottom of each fieldset.   $show_cancel_button: bool This defaults to false. If set to true, a cancel button is displayed at the bottom of the form. Clicking on it returns to the previous page in the browser\u0026rsquo;s history. $show_toolbar: bool This defaults to false and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $submit_action: string This property handles a hidden field of the same name that will be added to the form, with its value set to \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;. This will also be used as default name for the submit button, unless otherwise specified in the form\u0026rsquo;s input configuration. If not defined, its default value is \u0026quot;submitAdd{$table}\u0026quot; (read about $table below).\n $table: string Table name where the data is stored, without prefix (e.g. \u0026quot;configuration\u0026quot;). This is only required in the following cases:  If $submit_action has not been defined. If the form includes a shop (shop association) input field. If there are multiple forms on the same page.   $title: string This default to null and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $token: string CSRF token that will be appended to the form\u0026rsquo;s action URL, if $currentIndex is defined. $toolbar_scroll: bool This defaults to false and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $tpl_vars: array This allows you to add new Smarty variables to the template or override the ones set by HelperForm.  Form declaration The form declaration follows a precise schema. At its root, it\u0026rsquo;s a collection of form sections, also referred to as \u0026ldquo;fieldsets\u0026rdquo;. Each form section contains exactly one \u0026ldquo;form\u0026rdquo; declaration, like this:\n$form = [ $firstSectionId =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $firstSectionDeclaration], $secondSectionId =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $secondSectionDeclaration], // ...more sections ]; It\u0026rsquo;s usually not necessary to set up identifiers for the forms sections, and most forms will only have one section, like so:\n$form = [ [\u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $formDeclaration] ]; $formDeclaration is an array containing several properties, explained below.\nSection heading The legend property lets you configure the form\u0026rsquo;s heading.\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;legend\u0026#39;] = [ \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-cogs\u0026#39;, // Icon to display next to the tile  \u0026#39;image\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;//url/image.png\u0026#39;, // URL of an image that will be displayed next to the title  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Edit carrier\u0026#39;), // (Required) Title for this form section. ]; Messages You can display different messages at the top of the form by declaring the appropriate property.\n$formDeclaration = [ \u0026#39;description\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;This form is used for doing foo bar\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;warning\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Warning: dangerous stuff ahead!\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;succcess\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Form saved!\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;error\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Oops, something went wrong.\u0026#39;), ]; Buttons You can add a submit button to the form by setting the submit property.\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;submit\u0026#39;] = [ \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;send\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of \u0026#34;{$table}_form_submit_btn\u0026#34;  \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-save\u0026#39;, // Icon to show  \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;send\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of the $submit_action property  \u0026#39;stay\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; false, // If true, this will append \u0026#34;AndStay\u0026#34; to the name  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, // CSS class to add  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Save\u0026#39;, // Button label ]; To add a reset button, declare the reset property. It has most of the same values as submit:\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;reset\u0026#39;] = [ \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;reset\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of \u0026#34;{$table}_form_reset_btn\u0026#34;  \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-reset\u0026#39;, // Icon to show, if any  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, // CSS class to add  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Reset\u0026#39;, // Button label ]; It\u0026rsquo;s possible to add any number of supplementary buttons, by declaring the buttons array:\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;buttons\u0026#39;] = [ [ \u0026#39;href\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;//url\u0026#39;, // If this is set, the button will be an \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag  \u0026#39;js\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;someFunction()\u0026#39;, // Javascript to execute on click  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, // CSS class to add  \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;button\u0026#39;, // Button type  \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;mybutton\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;mybutton\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of \u0026#34;submitOptions{$table}\u0026#34;  \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-foo\u0026#39;, // Icon to show, if any  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Do stuff\u0026#39;, // Button label  ], [ // more buttons  ] ];  All buttons are added at the bottom of the form\u0026rsquo;s section. Each section may have its own submit button, but all sections are part of the same form. Fields The input property takes an array that defines the form\u0026rsquo;s structure. Using the various offered possibilities, you can build just about any type of form, and be assured that it will comply with PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s style and form processing.\nYou can use as many element arrays as necessary for your form, one after the other.\nExample:\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;] = [ [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;my_field\u0026#39;, // ...more properties  ], [ // ...another field  ], ] Each field definition has different properties, depending on the chosen type.\n $type: string (required) Input type. Can be one of the following:\ntext, select, textarea, radio, checkbox, file, shop, asso_shop, free, color $label: string Input label. Theoretically optional, but in reality each field has to have a label. $name: string (required) Field name. This will define name of the object property from which we get the value. $required: bool False by default. If true, PrestaShop will add a red star next to the field. $desc: string Description displayed under the field. $hint: string This hint is displayed when the mouse hovers the field. $suffix: string This is displayed after the field (e.g. to indicate the unit of measure). $empty_message: string Mesage to display when the field is empty. $lang: bool False by default. If true, it indicates that the field is multi language.  Text input Here is how to generate a basic \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; element:\narray( \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, // This is a regular \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;label\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;), // The \u0026lt;label\u0026gt; for this \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, // The content of the \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; attribute of the \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;lg\u0026#39;, // The content of the \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; attribute of the \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.

Basic usage Removing all the optional fields, this is how to build a basic HelperForm element:\n$helper = new HelperForm(); $form = [ [ \u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;legend\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Edit carrier\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-cogs\u0026#39; ], \u0026#39;input\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;shipping_method\u0026#39;, ], ], \u0026#39;submit\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Save\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;btn btn-default pull-right\u0026#39; ], ], ], ]; $helper-\u0026gt;generateForm($form); This specific code generates this HTML code:\n\u0026lt;form id=\u0026#34;configuration_form\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;post\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;panel\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;fieldset_0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;panel-heading\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;icon-cogs\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;Edit carrier \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;form-wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;form-group\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;shipping_method\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;shipping_method\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;panel-footer\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;btn btn-default pull-right\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Save\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;_form_submit_btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; To learn more about the $form array structure, read the Form declaration section below.\nAttributes  $allow_employee_form_lang: int This defaults to 0 and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $back_url: string This defaults to # and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $currentIndex: string This URL will be set as the form\u0026rsquo;s action. $default_form_language: int (required) Default language id (notably for multi language fields). $fields_form: array Form structure, as described in the Form declaration section below. $fields_value: array Form values, using field names as keys. $first_call: bool This defaults to true. Set to false to avoid injecting scripts again when displaying more than one form in a single page. $id: string Value for the ID field (see $identifier below). $identifier: string Name of the ID field in the table where data is stored, if applicable. If present, a hidden field named the same as this variable will be added, and its value will be set to the $id attribute. $languages: array List of active languages, indexed by id_lang. You can usually get this from AdminController::getLanguages().\nThe expected structure is: array\u0026lt;int, array{id_lang: int, iso_code: string, is_default: bool, name: string}\u0026gt;. $module: Module Instance of the module using this form. This is only needed to allow the module to override the form\u0026rsquo;s template. $name_controller: string If set, this will:  Add a class of the same name to the \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; tag. Execute a hook named display\u0026lt;$name_controller\u0026gt;Form at the bottom of each fieldset.   $show_cancel_button: bool This defaults to false. If set to true, a cancel button is displayed at the bottom of the form. Clicking on it returns to the previous page in the browser\u0026rsquo;s history. $show_toolbar: bool This defaults to false and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $submit_action: string This property handles a hidden field of the same name that will be added to the form, with its value set to \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;. This will also be used as default name for the submit button, unless otherwise specified in the form\u0026rsquo;s input configuration. If not defined, its default value is \u0026quot;submitAdd{$table}\u0026quot; (read about $table below).\n $table: string Table name where the data is stored, without prefix (e.g. \u0026quot;configuration\u0026quot;). This is only required in the following cases:  If $submit_action has not been defined. If the form includes a shop (shop association) input field. If there are multiple forms on the same page.   $title: string This default to null and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $token: string CSRF token that will be appended to the form\u0026rsquo;s action URL, if $currentIndex is defined. $toolbar_scroll: bool This defaults to false and has no effect in PrestaShop 1.7. $tpl_vars: array This allows you to add new Smarty variables to the template or override the ones set by HelperForm.  Form declaration The form declaration follows a precise schema. At its root, it\u0026rsquo;s a collection of form sections, also referred to as \u0026ldquo;fieldsets\u0026rdquo;. Each form section contains exactly one \u0026ldquo;form\u0026rdquo; declaration, like this:\n$form = [ $firstSectionId =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $firstSectionDeclaration], $secondSectionId =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $secondSectionDeclaration], // ...more sections ]; It\u0026rsquo;s usually not necessary to set up identifiers for the forms sections, and most forms will only have one section, like so:\n$form = [ [\u0026#39;form\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $formDeclaration] ]; $formDeclaration is an array containing several properties, explained below.\nSection heading The legend property lets you configure the form\u0026rsquo;s heading.\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;legend\u0026#39;] = [ \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-cogs\u0026#39;, // Icon to display next to the tile  \u0026#39;image\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;//url/image.png\u0026#39;, // URL of an image that will be displayed next to the title  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Edit carrier\u0026#39;), // (Required) Title for this form section. ]; Messages You can display different messages at the top of the form by declaring the appropriate property.\n$formDeclaration = [ \u0026#39;description\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;This form is used for doing foo bar\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;warning\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Warning: dangerous stuff ahead!\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;succcess\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Form saved!\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;error\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Oops, something went wrong.\u0026#39;), ]; Buttons You can add a submit button to the form by setting the submit property.\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;submit\u0026#39;] = [ \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;send\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of \u0026#34;{$table}_form_submit_btn\u0026#34;  \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-save\u0026#39;, // Icon to show  \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;send\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of the $submit_action property  \u0026#39;stay\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; false, // If true, this will append \u0026#34;AndStay\u0026#34; to the name  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, // CSS class to add  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Save\u0026#39;, // Button label ]; To add a reset button, declare the reset property. It has most of the same values as submit:\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;reset\u0026#39;] = [ \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;reset\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of \u0026#34;{$table}_form_reset_btn\u0026#34;  \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-reset\u0026#39;, // Icon to show, if any  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, // CSS class to add  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Reset\u0026#39;, // Button label ]; It\u0026rsquo;s possible to add any number of supplementary buttons, by declaring the buttons array:\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;buttons\u0026#39;] = [ [ \u0026#39;href\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;//url\u0026#39;, // If this is set, the button will be an \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag  \u0026#39;js\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;someFunction()\u0026#39;, // Javascript to execute on click  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, // CSS class to add  \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;button\u0026#39;, // Button type  \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;mybutton\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;mybutton\u0026#39;, // If not defined, this will take the value of \u0026#34;submitOptions{$table}\u0026#34;  \u0026#39;icon\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;icon-foo\u0026#39;, // Icon to show, if any  \u0026#39;title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Do stuff\u0026#39;, // Button label  ], [ // more buttons  ] ];  All buttons are added at the bottom of the form\u0026rsquo;s section. Each section may have its own submit button, but all sections are part of the same form. Fields The input property takes an array that defines the form\u0026rsquo;s structure. Using the various offered possibilities, you can build just about any type of form, and be assured that it will comply with PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s style and form processing.\nYou can use as many element arrays as necessary for your form, one after the other.\nExample:\n$formDeclaration[\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;] = [ [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;my_field\u0026#39;, // ...more properties  ], [ // ...another field  ], ] Each field definition has different properties, depending on the chosen type.\n $type: string (required) Input type. Can be one of the following:\ntext, select, textarea, radio, checkbox, file, shop, asso_shop, free, color $label: string Input label. Theoretically optional, but in reality each field has to have a label. $name: string (required) Field name. This will define name of the object property from which we get the value. $required: bool False by default. If true, PrestaShop will add a red star next to the field. $desc: string Description displayed under the field. $hint: string This hint is displayed when the mouse hovers the field. $suffix: string This is displayed after the field (e.g. to indicate the unit of measure). $empty_message: string Mesage to display when the field is empty. $lang: bool False by default. If true, it indicates that the field is multi language.  Text input Here is how to generate a basic \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; element:\narray( \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;text\u0026#39;, // This is a regular \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;label\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;l(\u0026#39;Name\u0026#39;), // The \u0026lt;label\u0026gt; for this \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, // The content of the \u0026#39;id\u0026#39; attribute of the \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;lg\u0026#39;, // The content of the \u0026#39;class\u0026#39; attribute of the \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag.

It must contain two keys: id and name.\n$options can take this value:\n$options = array( array( \u0026#39;id_option\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1, // The value of the \u0026#39;value\u0026#39; attribute of the \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; tag.  \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Method 1\u0026#39; // The value of the text content of the \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; tag.  ), array( \u0026#39;id_option\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 2, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;Method 2\u0026#39; ), ); \u0026hellip;but of course, you would be better off generating such an array of arrays yourself, from the data stored in PrestaShop.

variable).\nOther HTML elements The type variable of the element declaration makes it possible to generate just about any kind of \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; element: text, select, textarea, radio, checkbox, file and many others! See the list of available types here.\nYou can also use some PrestaShop specific: shop, asso_shop, free, color. Try them out!\n"

This action is useful if you want to show other information about the row (for example, the details of a sum).\nThis action is represented by a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; if the details is shown and by a \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; if the details is hidden. The content is obtained through an Ajax request.\nExample There are two possible ways to displays:\n The easy one is to re-use the table structure. See for instance the \u0026ldquo;Stock instant state\u0026rdquo; page, under the \u0026ldquo;Stock\u0026rdquo; menu (when the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Stock Management\u0026rdquo; option is enabled). You can define your own structure (for example, to display a new table within the table). See for instance the \u0026ldquo;Stock Management\u0026rdquo; page, under the \u0026ldquo;Stock\u0026rdquo; menu (when the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Stock Management\u0026rdquo; option is enabled).  Add the action To add the \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; action, use the following function in the target AdminController:\n$this-\u0026gt;addRowAction(\u0026#39;details\u0026#39;); Ajax generalities Ajax requests must be generated by the ajaxProcess() method in your AdminController.\nOnly one element is sent to the request: the table row\u0026rsquo;s id. You can get it by using:\n(int) Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;); This id is defined either in the $identifier class attribute, or by the table name ($table attribute), prefixed by id_.\nThis function must display the result in JSON format.\nPerforming an Ajax request on the table\u0026rsquo;s structure The expected JSON format:\n{ use_parent_structure: true, // Optional.  data: // Here is the SQL result.  [ {field_name: \u0026#39;value\u0026#39;} ], fields_display: // $fieldsDisplay attribute for the AdminController. } Sample Ajax request code:\npublic function ajaxProcess() { $query = \u0026#39;SELECT * FROM mytable\u0026#39;; echo Tools::jsonEncode(array( \u0026#39;data\u0026#39;=\u0026gt; Db::getInstance(_PS_USE_SQL_SLAVE_)-\u0026gt;executeS($query), \u0026#39;fields_display\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;fieldsDisplay )); die(); } Performing an Ajax request using your own structure The expected JSON format:\n{ use_parent_structure: false, data: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My HTML content\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#39; } "

This action is useful if you want to show other information about the row (for example, the details of a sum).\nThis action is represented by a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; if the details is shown and by a \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; if the details is hidden. The content is obtained through an Ajax request.\nExample There are two possible ways to displays:\n The easy one is to re-use the table structure. See for instance the \u0026ldquo;Stock instant state\u0026rdquo; page, under the \u0026ldquo;Stock\u0026rdquo; menu (when the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Stock Management\u0026rdquo; option is enabled). You can define your own structure (for example, to display a new table within the table). See for instance the \u0026ldquo;Stock Management\u0026rdquo; page, under the \u0026ldquo;Stock\u0026rdquo; menu (when the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Stock Management\u0026rdquo; option is enabled).  Add the action To add the \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; action, use the following function in the target AdminController:\n$this-\u0026gt;addRowAction(\u0026#39;details\u0026#39;); Ajax generalities Ajax requests must be generated by the ajaxProcess() method in your AdminController.\nOnly one element is sent to the request: the table row\u0026rsquo;s id. You can get it by using:\n(int) Tools::getValue(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;); This id is defined either in the $identifier class attribute, or by the table name ($table attribute), prefixed by id_.\nThis function must display the result in JSON format.\nPerforming an Ajax request on the table\u0026rsquo;s structure The expected JSON format:\n{ use_parent_structure: true, // Optional.  data: // Here is the SQL result.  [ {field_name: \u0026#39;value\u0026#39;} ], fields_display: // $fieldsDisplay attribute for the AdminController. } Sample Ajax request code:\npublic function ajaxProcess() { $query = \u0026#39;SELECT * FROM mytable\u0026#39;; echo Tools::jsonEncode(array( \u0026#39;data\u0026#39;=\u0026gt; Db::getInstance(_PS_USE_SQL_SLAVE_)-\u0026gt;executeS($query), \u0026#39;fields_display\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;fieldsDisplay )); die(); } Performing an Ajax request using your own structure The expected JSON format:\n{ use_parent_structure: false, data: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My HTML content\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#39; } "

Your configuration code should only target the current store using the current Context, which every Configuration method does automatically.\nIn the few occasions where you need to apply a new value to the same Configuration variable for all existing stores, using the Configuration::updateGlobalValue('myVariable', 'myValue') method.

Configuration::get(\u0026#39;BLOCKADVERT_IMG_EXT\u0026#39;); Building database tables that support multistore There can be several scenarios:\n The object/entity exists in some stores, but not in all of them: you should use an associative table, and handle it using id_group_shop. The object/entity exists in all stores: use the regular tables, with a custom field. Handle it using id_entity, id_group_shop and the attributes. The language must be different for every store: handle it using id_shop in the _lang table.  Object in some stores only When building SQL queries that manage module data, the method to use is Shop::addSqlRestriction($share = false, $alias = null).\nIt makes it possible to add restrictions to a SQL query, in order to retrieve information on a shop or a shop group.\nThe parameters are optional:\n $share: is used to add a WHERE clause indicating that we are in the same group as the current store. $alias: is used to set the table alias to which the WHERE clause should be applied.  For instance, this query retrieves visitor connections from a given shop:\n\u0026#39;SELECT date_add, COUNT(`date_add`) as total FROM `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;connections` WHERE 1 \u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlRestriction(); Object in all stores The method to use is Shop::addSqlAssociation($table, $alias, $inner_join = true, $on = null, $force_not_default = false).\nIt makes it possible to add a JOIN clause to the SQL query, joining a table and its associated table in multistore mode.\nFor instance, this query automatically associates the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product_shop' table to the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product' table using the p alias:\n\u0026#39;SELECT wp.`id_product` FROM `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;wishlist_product` wp LEFT JOIN `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;product` p ON p.`id_product` = wp.`id_product` \u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlAssociation(\u0026#39;product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;); This way, the joint between the information from the product and the current store\u0026rsquo;s context is applied.\nDifferent language in every store The method to use is Shop::addSqlRestrictionOnLang($alias = null, $id_shop = null).\nIt makes it possible to add a restriction on id_shop for a multishop language table.\nFor instance, this query automatically associates the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product_lang' table to the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'wishlist_product' table using the pl alias:\n\u0026#39;SELECT wp.`id_product` FROM `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;wishlist_product` wp LEFT JOIN `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;product` p ON p.`id_product` = wp.`id_product` \u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlAssociation(\u0026#39;product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39; LEFT JOIN `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;product_lang` pl ON pl.`id_product` = wp.`id_product`\u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlRestrictionOnLang(\u0026#39;pl\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39; WHERE pl.`id_lang` = \u0026#39; . (int) $id_lang; This way, the joint between the language information of the product and the current store language is applied.\n"

Configuration::get(\u0026#39;BLOCKADVERT_IMG_EXT\u0026#39;); Building database tables that support multistore There can be several scenarios:\n The object/entity exists in some stores, but not in all of them: you should use an associative table, and handle it using id_group_shop. The object/entity exists in all stores: use the regular tables, with a custom field. Handle it using id_entity, id_group_shop and the attributes. The language must be different for every store: handle it using id_shop in the _lang table.  Object in some stores only When building SQL queries that manage module data, the method to use is Shop::addSqlRestriction($share = false, $alias = null).\nIt makes it possible to add restrictions to a SQL query, in order to retrieve information on a shop or a shop group.\nThe parameters are optional:\n $share: is used to add a WHERE clause indicating that we are in the same group as the current store. $alias: is used to set the table alias to which the WHERE clause should be applied.  For instance, this query retrieves visitor connections from a given shop:\n\u0026#39;SELECT date_add, COUNT(`date_add`) as total FROM `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;connections` WHERE 1 \u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlRestriction(); Object in all stores The method to use is Shop::addSqlAssociation($table, $alias, $inner_join = true, $on = null, $force_not_default = false).\nIt makes it possible to add a JOIN clause to the SQL query, joining a table and its associated table in multistore mode.\nFor instance, this query automatically associates the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product_shop' table to the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product' table using the p alias:\n\u0026#39;SELECT wp.`id_product` FROM `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;wishlist_product` wp LEFT JOIN `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;product` p ON p.`id_product` = wp.`id_product` \u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlAssociation(\u0026#39;product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;); This way, the joint between the information from the product and the current store\u0026rsquo;s context is applied.\nDifferent language in every store The method to use is Shop::addSqlRestrictionOnLang($alias = null, $id_shop = null).\nIt makes it possible to add a restriction on id_shop for a multishop language table.\nFor instance, this query automatically associates the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'product_lang' table to the _DB_PREFIX_ . 'wishlist_product' table using the pl alias:\n\u0026#39;SELECT wp.`id_product` FROM `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;wishlist_product` wp LEFT JOIN `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;product` p ON p.`id_product` = wp.`id_product` \u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlAssociation(\u0026#39;product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39; LEFT JOIN `\u0026#39; . _DB_PREFIX_ . \u0026#39;product_lang` pl ON pl.`id_product` = wp.`id_product`\u0026#39; . Shop::addSqlRestrictionOnLang(\u0026#39;pl\u0026#39;) . \u0026#39; WHERE pl.`id_lang` = \u0026#39; . (int) $id_lang; This way, the joint between the language information of the product and the current store language is applied.\n"

The class implements accessors for each attribute.\nDefining the model You must use the $definition static variable in order to define the model.\nFor instance:\n/** * Example from the CMS model (CMSCore) */ public static $definition = [ \u0026#39;table\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;cms\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;primary\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;id_cms\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;multilang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;fields\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; array( \u0026#39;id_cms_category\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_INT, \u0026#39;validate\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;isUnsignedInt\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;position\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_INT], \u0026#39;active\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [\u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_BOOL], // Language fields  \u0026#39;meta_description\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_STRING, \u0026#39;lang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;validate\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;isGenericName\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 255 ], \u0026#39;meta_keywords\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_STRING, \u0026#39;lang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;validate\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;isGenericName\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 255 ], \u0026#39;meta_title\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_STRING, \u0026#39;lang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;validate\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;isGenericName\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;required\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 128 ], \u0026#39;link_rewrite\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_STRING, \u0026#39;lang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;validate\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;isLinkRewrite\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;required\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 128 ], \u0026#39;content\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;type\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; self::TYPE_HTML, \u0026#39;lang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;validate\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;isString\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;size\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 3999999999999 ], ) ]; Multiple stores and/or languages In order to retrieve an object in many languages:\n\u0026#39;multilang\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true In order to retrieve an object depending on the current store:\n\u0026#39;multishop\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true In order to retrieve an object which depends on the current store, and in many languages:\n\u0026#39;multilang_shop\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true Main methods  __construct($id = NULL, $id_lang = NULL) Build object. add($autodate = true, $nullValues = false) Adds current object to the database. associateTo(integer|array $id_shops) Associate an item to its context. delete() Delete current object from database. deleteImage(mixed $force_delete = false) Delete images associated with the object. deleteSelection($selection) Delete several objects from database. getFields() Prepare fields for ObjectModel class (add, update). getValidationRules($className = _CLASS_) Return object validation rules (field validity). save($nullValues = false, $autodate = true) Save current object to database (add or update). toggleStatus() Toggle object\u0026rsquo;s status in database. update($nullValues = false) Update current object to database. validateFields($die = true, $errorReturn = false) Check for field validity before database interaction.   ObjectModel lifecycle Thanks to the hooks, you can alter the Object Model or execute functions during the lifecycle of your models. Every hook receive an instance of the manipulated object model:\n ObjectModel lifecycle   As an example, this is how you can retrieve information about a product when we delete it from the database:\nuse Product; // In a module  public function hookActionObjectProductDeleteAfter(Product $product) { PrestaShopLogger::addLog( sprintf(\u0026#39;Product with id %s was deleted with success\u0026#39;, $product-\u0026gt;id_product) ); } "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Optimize your PrestaShop performance Before making any change on your PrestaShop instance, it is highly recommended to perform some benchmarks.\nThe idea behind this is to know what your baseline performance is, so that you can make sure that your changes are increasing your shop\u0026rsquo;s performance and not the other way around.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve done no benchmark beforehand, there is no way to ensure you did not decrease your performances in the end.\nKeep in mind that the surest way to tune your shop is:\n benchmark make a change repeat   Finding your bottleneck(s) Performance tuning can be a tricky thing, there are plenty of factors that can slow down an application.\nIt can come from your disks, lack of memory, network capacity, CPU: wherever you can think of.\nThen, the challenge is to find your current bottleneck (could be disks access), remove it and then find the next one (could be memory).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no way to enumerate all the performance issues we\u0026rsquo;ve encountered, but let\u0026rsquo;s review the more common ones and tackle them.\n1) PHP PHP tuning is very important for your application’s performance, whether you’re running PrestaShop or any other PHP software.\nFirst, try to use PHP \u0026gt;=7 when possible. Hard work has been done on performance starting on this version and it will provide a nice speed boost to your shop!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using PHP-FPM (which should be the case for most \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; installations), you have to check the pool configuration. It\u0026rsquo;s usually stored in the file /etc/php/7.x/fpm/pool.d/www.conf. Inside this file, the most important setting is the pm.max_children setting. It must be greater than the max number of concurrent users you want to simulate during the bench.\nNote this PHP configuration should be used on Production environments only. Use the following settings to optimize the performances:\n[Date] date.timezone = UTC [Session] session.auto_start = Off [PHP] short_open_tag = Off display_errors = Off magic_quotes_gpc = off ; Increase this value if you are able to do it memory_limit = 512M max_execution_time = 300 max_input_time = 300 upload_max_filesize = 20M post_max_size = 22M ; Increase this value if you work with products with a lot of combinations max_input_vars = 20000 allow_url_fopen = on 2) PHP \u0026amp; File system It is well known that PHP does not manage file systems very well.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why there are plenty of useful tuning options to avoid accessing the file system constantly.\nrealpath_cache At each file access, by default, PHP will first check that the file is still there, causing plenty of lstat system calls. Potentially thousands.\nPHP provides an option to store this information in cache, so that it can avoid repeating those system calls constantly:\n[PHP] realpath_cache_size = 4096K realpath_cache_ttl = 600 Keep in mind that this configuration is NOT compatible with other parameters, such as open_basedir and safe_mode directives.\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re using a NAS or any other network storage solution to store your files (in case of horizontal scaling, for example), it is highly recommended to enable this setting.\nopcache Because file system tuning is a never ending story, not only you can cache the files' path, but also its contents.\nGood news is, OPCache will not only store your PHP files in memory, but it will store their bytecode, meaning the already compiled application, in a shared memory, available to all the application\u0026rsquo;s calls:\n[opcache] opcache.enable=1 opcache.enable_cli=0 opcache.memory_consumption=256 opcache.interned_strings_buffer=32 opcache.max_accelerated_files=16229 opcache.max_wasted_percentage=10 opcache.revalidate_freq=10 opcache.fast_shutdown=1 opcache.enable_file_override=0 opcache.max_file_size=0 If you can manage it, here are few options you could configure:\nopcache.validate_timestamps=0 opcache.revalidate_path=0 Keep in mind if you deactivate validate_timestamps OPCache will never update your code unless you let it know explicitly (either through internal functions or by restarting the web server).\nAlso, your favorite ecommerce project made sure it\u0026rsquo;s fully compatible with OPCache.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it nice?\n3) Composer (Autoloading optimizations) The class loader used while developing the application is optimized to find new and changed classes. On production servers, PHP files should never change, unless a new application version is deployed. That\u0026rsquo;s why you can optimize Composer\u0026rsquo;s autoloader to scan the entire application once and build a \u0026ldquo;class map\u0026rdquo;, which is a big array of all the classes locations, stored in vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php.\nExecute this command to generate the class map (and make it part of your deployment process):\ncomposer dump-autoload --optimize --no-dev --classmap-authoritative  --optimize: dumps every PSR-0 and PSR-4 compatible class used in your application; --no-dev: excludes the classes that are only needed in the development environment (e.g. tests); --classmap-authoritative: prevents Composer from scanning the file system for classes that are not found in the class map.  If you install a new module in production, you need to execute this command again. 4) Apache Settings If you\u0026rsquo;re using PHP-FPM, you should be able to use Apache mpm_event. Using the following configuration (to set in the mpm_event.conf file) should allow you to test up to 400 concurrent users:\nServerLimit 16 MaxClients 400 StartServers 3 ThreadLimit 64 ThreadsPerChild 25 MaxRequestWorkers 400 MaxConnectionsPerChild 0 5) MySQL/MariaDB Settings Though we’re discussing it just now, MySQL tuning is just as important.\nOur intention here is to optimize the instance’s throughput by adding caches.\nAs for PHP, it allows the service to work as much as possible in memory and avoid disk access, hence reducing latency.\nCaching These parameters allow better cache information for further reuse, first by enabling it, then by increasing its size. Again, the idea is to keep the query results in memory rather than looking them up to the (higher latency) hard drive.\nAs always, these values should be adjusted to your own environment, you probably won’t need a host_cache_size of 1000.\nquery_cache_limit = 128K query_cache_size = 32M query_cache_type = ON table_open_cache = 4000 thread_cache_size = 80 host_cache_size=1000 Buffering Buffering is almost another word for caching.\nSo we work here with the memory area that holds cached data for InnoDB tables, indexes, and other auxiliary buffers, etc..\nAgain, these options should be adapted to your shop.\nSetting up the innodb_buffer_pool_size to 1G may be too much for your SQL instance, just make sure you have enough memory according to the value you configure.\nThe important thing is, if possible, to set innodb_buffer_pool_size to a greater value than your database size.\nread_buffer_size\t= 2M read_rnd_buffer_size\t= 1M join_buffer_size\t= 2M sort_buffer_size = 2M innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G Other parameters Some other parameters to increase the MySQL performance, such as disabling the performance schema (used for monitoring), memory tables and enhancing GROUP BY queries.\nperformance_schema = OFF max_heap_table_size = 32M tmp_table_size = 32M Before launching the benchmark, and after importing the data, it\u0026rsquo;s always great to launch an ANALYZE TABLE on all your database by running on your server:\nmysqlcheck -a -A -uroot -pyour_password 6) Use a CDN A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a kind of proxy that will cache your static files and serve them instead of your own server.\nHence, a CDN will reduce drastically the amount of hits made to your server.\nThere are plenty of CDN providers, Cloudflare is a good and free one. You can use as well to minify your page or to easily enable SSL on your site.\nJust one slight consideration about CDNs though: any modification done to your shop\u0026rsquo;s static assets, such as images, css and the like, may not be immediately available once behind a CDN. When those files are cached, if you modify them on your server, you will need to wait for the cache expiration (often configurable) before seeing the modification live - or invalidate part or all your cache. Most providers offer such features.\n7) PrestaShop Settings In the performances tab of your PrestaShop (Advanced Parameters \u0026gt; Performance):\n Do not enable \u0026ldquo;Multi-Front synchronisation\u0026rdquo; if you only have one front server or if your smarty cache is shared across all your front servers on the same file system.

	"content": "Optimize your PrestaShop performance Before making any change on your PrestaShop instance, it is highly recommended to perform some benchmarks.\nThe idea behind this is to know what your baseline performance is, so that you can make sure that your changes are increasing your shop\u0026rsquo;s performance and not the other way around.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve done no benchmark beforehand, there is no way to ensure you did not decrease your performances in the end.\nKeep in mind that the surest way to tune your shop is:\n benchmark make a change repeat   Finding your bottleneck(s) Performance tuning can be a tricky thing, there are plenty of factors that can slow down an application.\nIt can come from your disks, lack of memory, network capacity, CPU: wherever you can think of.\nThen, the challenge is to find your current bottleneck (could be disks access), remove it and then find the next one (could be memory).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no way to enumerate all the performance issues we\u0026rsquo;ve encountered, but let\u0026rsquo;s review the more common ones and tackle them.\n1) PHP PHP tuning is very important for your application’s performance, whether you’re running PrestaShop or any other PHP software.\nFirst, try to use PHP \u0026gt;=7 when possible. Hard work has been done on performance starting on this version and it will provide a nice speed boost to your shop!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using PHP-FPM (which should be the case for most \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; installations), you have to check the pool configuration. It\u0026rsquo;s usually stored in the file /etc/php/7.x/fpm/pool.d/www.conf. Inside this file, the most important setting is the pm.max_children setting. It must be greater than the max number of concurrent users you want to simulate during the bench.\nNote this PHP configuration should be used on Production environments only. Use the following settings to optimize the performances:\n[Date] date.timezone = UTC [Session] session.auto_start = Off [PHP] short_open_tag = Off display_errors = Off magic_quotes_gpc = off ; Increase this value if you are able to do it memory_limit = 512M max_execution_time = 300 max_input_time = 300 upload_max_filesize = 20M post_max_size = 22M ; Increase this value if you work with products with a lot of combinations max_input_vars = 20000 allow_url_fopen = on 2) PHP \u0026amp; File system It is well known that PHP does not manage file systems very well.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why there are plenty of useful tuning options to avoid accessing the file system constantly.\nrealpath_cache At each file access, by default, PHP will first check that the file is still there, causing plenty of lstat system calls. Potentially thousands.\nPHP provides an option to store this information in cache, so that it can avoid repeating those system calls constantly:\n[PHP] realpath_cache_size = 4096K realpath_cache_ttl = 600 Keep in mind that this configuration is NOT compatible with other parameters, such as open_basedir and safe_mode directives.\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re using a NAS or any other network storage solution to store your files (in case of horizontal scaling, for example), it is highly recommended to enable this setting.\nopcache Because file system tuning is a never ending story, not only you can cache the files' path, but also its contents.\nGood news is, OPCache will not only store your PHP files in memory, but it will store their bytecode, meaning the already compiled application, in a shared memory, available to all the application\u0026rsquo;s calls:\n[opcache] opcache.enable=1 opcache.enable_cli=0 opcache.memory_consumption=256 opcache.interned_strings_buffer=32 opcache.max_accelerated_files=16229 opcache.max_wasted_percentage=10 opcache.revalidate_freq=10 opcache.fast_shutdown=1 opcache.enable_file_override=0 opcache.max_file_size=0 If you can manage it, here are few options you could configure:\nopcache.validate_timestamps=0 opcache.revalidate_path=0 Keep in mind if you deactivate validate_timestamps OPCache will never update your code unless you let it know explicitly (either through internal functions or by restarting the web server).\nAlso, your favorite ecommerce project made sure it\u0026rsquo;s fully compatible with OPCache.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it nice?\n3) Composer (Autoloading optimizations) The class loader used while developing the application is optimized to find new and changed classes. On production servers, PHP files should never change, unless a new application version is deployed. That\u0026rsquo;s why you can optimize Composer\u0026rsquo;s autoloader to scan the entire application once and build a \u0026ldquo;class map\u0026rdquo;, which is a big array of all the classes locations, stored in vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php.\nExecute this command to generate the class map (and make it part of your deployment process):\ncomposer dump-autoload --optimize --no-dev --classmap-authoritative  --optimize: dumps every PSR-0 and PSR-4 compatible class used in your application; --no-dev: excludes the classes that are only needed in the development environment (e.g. tests); --classmap-authoritative: prevents Composer from scanning the file system for classes that are not found in the class map.  If you install a new module in production, you need to execute this command again. 4) Apache Settings If you\u0026rsquo;re using PHP-FPM, you should be able to use Apache mpm_event. Using the following configuration (to set in the mpm_event.conf file) should allow you to test up to 400 concurrent users:\nServerLimit 16 MaxClients 400 StartServers 3 ThreadLimit 64 ThreadsPerChild 25 MaxRequestWorkers 400 MaxConnectionsPerChild 0 5) MySQL/MariaDB Settings Though we’re discussing it just now, MySQL tuning is just as important.\nOur intention here is to optimize the instance’s throughput by adding caches.\nAs for PHP, it allows the service to work as much as possible in memory and avoid disk access, hence reducing latency.\nCaching These parameters allow better cache information for further reuse, first by enabling it, then by increasing its size. Again, the idea is to keep the query results in memory rather than looking them up to the (higher latency) hard drive.\nAs always, these values should be adjusted to your own environment, you probably won’t need a host_cache_size of 1000.\nquery_cache_limit = 128K query_cache_size = 32M query_cache_type = ON table_open_cache = 4000 thread_cache_size = 80 host_cache_size=1000 Buffering Buffering is almost another word for caching.\nSo we work here with the memory area that holds cached data for InnoDB tables, indexes, and other auxiliary buffers, etc..\nAgain, these options should be adapted to your shop.\nSetting up the innodb_buffer_pool_size to 1G may be too much for your SQL instance, just make sure you have enough memory according to the value you configure.\nThe important thing is, if possible, to set innodb_buffer_pool_size to a greater value than your database size.\nread_buffer_size\t= 2M read_rnd_buffer_size\t= 1M join_buffer_size\t= 2M sort_buffer_size = 2M innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G Other parameters Some other parameters to increase the MySQL performance, such as disabling the performance schema (used for monitoring), memory tables and enhancing GROUP BY queries.\nperformance_schema = OFF max_heap_table_size = 32M tmp_table_size = 32M Before launching the benchmark, and after importing the data, it\u0026rsquo;s always great to launch an ANALYZE TABLE on all your database by running on your server:\nmysqlcheck -a -A -uroot -pyour_password 6) Use a CDN A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a kind of proxy that will cache your static files and serve them instead of your own server.\nHence, a CDN will reduce drastically the amount of hits made to your server.\nThere are plenty of CDN providers, Cloudflare is a good and free one. You can use as well to minify your page or to easily enable SSL on your site.\nJust one slight consideration about CDNs though: any modification done to your shop\u0026rsquo;s static assets, such as images, css and the like, may not be immediately available once behind a CDN. When those files are cached, if you modify them on your server, you will need to wait for the cache expiration (often configurable) before seeing the modification live - or invalidate part or all your cache. Most providers offer such features.\n7) PrestaShop Settings In the performances tab of your PrestaShop (Advanced Parameters \u0026gt; Performance):\n Do not enable \u0026ldquo;Multi-Front synchronisation\u0026rdquo; if you only have one front server or if your smarty cache is shared across all your front servers on the same file system. Use the \u0026ldquo;File System\u0026rdquo; cache type, not \u0026ldquo;MySQL\u0026rdquo; Enable the Smarty cache Do not enable the Cache from the \u0026ldquo;Cache\u0026rdquo; section if you have MySQL (\u0026lt;8) / MariaDB on the same machine, the MySQL query cache will be more efficient. If you still want to enable it, if you have only 1 front, use APC, and if you have several front, use a unique central memcached server host (not localhost!)  In the file config/defines.inc.php:\n Run your shop in production mode by setting _PS_MODE_DEV_ to false.  if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_MODE_DEV_\u0026#39;)) { define(\u0026#39;_PS_MODE_DEV_\u0026#39;, false); }  Disable the profiler by setting _PS_DEBUG_PROFILING_ to false.  if (!defined(\u0026#39;_PS_DEBUG_PROFILING_\u0026#39;)) { define(\u0026#39;_PS_DEBUG_PROFILING_\u0026#39;, false); } 8) PrestaShop database cleaning Some SQL tables of PrestaShop can grow very big in time.

It allows the Back Office user to view the details of selected order and edit it. The related code can be found in following locations:\n Main twig template src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Sell/Order/Order/view.html.twig. Javascript (pre-compiled) admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/order/view.

Most handlers or domain services implementations can be found in Adapter namespace src/Adapter/Order  Once opened, the page will show following blocks:\n Actions block Customer block Products block Messages block History block Payments block  Page blocks Actions block  Order actions block   This block contains following actions:\n Status update - new order status can be selected from a dropdown. See OrderController::updateStatusAction. View invoice - generates invoice PDF. See OrderController::generateInvoicePdfAction. Print order - prepares and shows modified page layout for printing. This action is performed by javascript in admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/order/view Refund - read about refunds here. Next/Previous - allows to quickly jump to next or previous order in the list (simple href buttons redirecting to another View order page).  Customer block  Order customer block   Contains information like customer email, addresses, orders count, total spent sum. Click the View full details link to see more information about the customer (it redirects to Customers -\u0026gt; Customers -\u0026gt; View customer page). This block also allows following actions:\n Editing and selecting new customer shipping and/or invoice addresses (both of these actions opens a modal with a Customers -\u0026gt; Addresses -\u0026gt; Edit page inside an iframe using the Lite display mode of the Back Office). See OrderController::changeCustomerAddressAction. Adding a private note (Customer-\u0026gt;note). See CustomerController::setPrivateNoteAction.  Products block  Order products block   Contains a list of ordered products and prices summary. The list is rendered using javascript ajax by calling OrderController::getProductsListAction in order-view-page.js. The response of this action is not a json, but a rendered template.\nThe product list has a pagination feature, but it is only a front-end pagination (not the database level) - all the products are loaded into the memory and handled by javascript. See admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/order/view/order-product-renderer.js. The following actions can be done in this block (most of these actions are related to OrderDetail - one OrderDetail is equivalent to one row in a products list):\n Add a product - create additional OrderDetail for the Order. See OrderController::addProductAction. Remove product - remove the OrderDetail related to the selected product. See OrderController::deleteProductAction. Edit product price - modify the base price of the OrderDetail related to the selected product. See OrderController::updateProductAction. Edit product quantity - modify the quantity of the OrderDetail related to the selected product. See OrderController::updateProductAction. Add discount - create a new CartRule and assign it to this order. See OrderController::addCartRuleAction.  It is possible to have multiple invoices related to same order, therefore when editing a product or adding a discount you can select which invoice to use.\n Order invoice select    Messages block  Order messages in Back Office   This block shows order messages (relies on OrderMessage). These messages can be visible for the customer in Front Office order details or can stay hidden - that depends on the checkbox Display to customer.  Order messages in Front Office   Predefined message can be chosen in a dropdown which contains a list of message templates from Sell -\u0026gt; Customer service -\u0026gt; Order messages. This page can be quickly reached by clicking a shortcut link Configure predefined messages. Message sending is handled by OrderController::sendMessageAction, while the related javascript code is located in order-view-page-messages-handler.js.\nHistory block  Order history block   This block doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an actual title like others, but let\u0026rsquo;s just call it \u0026ldquo;History block\u0026rdquo; for now - it\u0026rsquo;s the one containing following tabs:\n Status - you can see transitions of this order statuses and update the status, you can also add an Order note in this tab. (Order-\u0026gt;note). See OrderController::setInternalNoteAction. Documents - this tab contains invoices list. Carriers - contains carriers information. You can change the current carrier and add a tracking number. See OrderController::updateShippingAction. Merchandise returns - information about refunds history.  Payments block  Order payments block   Shows a list of payments done for this order and allows manually adding a payment. See OrderController::addPaymentAction.\nIf order total and payments amount sum differs, then a warning in this block will notify the Back Office user about the difference.\n Payment difference warning    "

	"content": "Override or decorate a Core controller  If you want to extend the behavior of a Back Office page in PrestaShop, you have multiple options.\nMost of standard extension needs can be fulfilled using one hook.\nIf there is no hook available for your need, and you only need to modify the visual appearance of the page, you might want to override a template.\nBut sometimes you want to modify the page in a deeper way. In this case, you need to modify the controller\u0026rsquo;s behavior.\nIf the Back Office page you want to modify is powered by Symfony, you have 3 options:\n Remap the route to target a new Controller you created Override the existing Core controller Decorate the existing Core controller  Remap the route In Symfony, routes such as /sell/orders/orders are mapped to controllers by YAML configuration files such as this one:\n# src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/routing/admin/sell/orders/orders.ymladmin_orders_index:path:/sell/orders/orders/methods:[GET]defaults:_controller:PrestaShopBundle:Admin/Sell/Order/Order:index_legacy_controller:AdminOrders_legacy_link:AdminOrdersIn your module, you have the possibility to replace this configuration item by your own.\nSo for example, if you want that people browsing the Back Office on URL /sell/orders/orders/ to hit your own controller MyModule\\Controller\\DemoController instead of the Core\u0026rsquo;s, you can do this:\n# modules/your-module/config/routes.ymladmin_orders_index:path:/sell/orders/orders/methods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;MyModule\\Controller\\DemoController::demoAction\u0026#39;_disable_module_prefix:true In the above example, the path has not been changed, but you can change it to whatever you want (eg. /demo/orders). However, keep in mind that while this will re-route internal links, external or hardcoded links will keep targeting the old path. Keep the item _legacy_controller if your controller relies on it to configure a AdminSecurity annotation such as @AdminSecurity(\u0026quot;is_granted('read', request.get('_legacy_controller'))\u0026quot;)\nKeep the items _legacy_controller and _legacy_link if you want to reroute internal links and legacy URLs like index.php?controller=AdminOrders as well.\n Thanks to this, whenever an HTTP request is matched to the route admin_orders_index, then your controller demoAction() will be executed.\nThanks to option _disable_module_prefix: true (available from PS 1.7.7.0) the route path is /sell/orders/orders, just like the original route.\nRouting is computed and cached by Symfony. You will need to clear this cache for Symfony to acknowledge your updated routing. You can do it by using php bin/console cache:clear.\nIf you have trouble writing the right routing configuration for your controller, you can use Symfony debugger to dump the routes with php bin/console debug:router.\n Override the controller Since 1.7.7, PrestaShop Back Office controllers are registered as services, and like all public services, they can be overridden by modules.\nFor example, the controller responsible for the page \u0026ldquo;Improve \u0026gt; Design \u0026gt; CMS Pages\u0026rdquo; is registered with service ID PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageController.\nWith the following configuration item, we can override this configuration to make it target our custom module:\n# modules/your-module/config/services.yml\u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageController\u0026#39;:class:MyModule\\Controller\\DemoControllerThanks to this, whenever Symfony forwards a request to the Core controller PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageController it will be forwarded to DemoController instead.\nThis method is not recommended unless you intend to rewrite the whole controller. In addition, if the implementation is updated in later versions of PrestaShop, your override will ignore these updates, which might create bugs. If you have trouble writing the right service configuration for your controller, you can use Symfony debugger to dump the routes with php bin/console debug:container. It can also be helpful to find the service ID of the controller. Decorate the controller Instead of replacing the whole controller, we recommend extending its behavior using service decoration. By implementing the decorator pattern, you can keep most or all of the original behavior of the decorated controller, and only customize the parts you want.\nWhile you could achieve a similar end with an override (by making your controller extend the original one), the decorator pattern provides a greater degree of freedom, while leaving all complexity of initialization and dependency management to the service container. Back to the controller responsible for the page \u0026ldquo;Improve \u0026gt; Design \u0026gt; CMS Pages\u0026rdquo; which is registered with service ID PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageController.\nWith the following configuration item, we can decorate it with a custom controller in our module:\n# modules/your-module/config/services.ymlcustom_controller:class:MyModule\\Controller\\DemoControllerdecorates:PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageControllerarguments:[\u0026#39;@custom_controller.inner\u0026#39;]Thanks to this, whenever Symfony forwards a request to the Core controller PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageController it will be forwarded to DemoController instead. But what is different with overriding is that the decorated CmsPageController is injected into the constructor of DemoController, and we can use it:\n\u0026lt;?php namespace MyModule\\Controller; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Search\\Filters\\CmsPageCategoryFilters; use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Search\\Filters\\CmsPageFilters; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\FrameworkBundleAdminController; use PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\Improve\\Design\\CmsPageController; use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request; class DemoController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { /** * @var CmsPageController */ private $decoratedController; public function __construct(CmsPageController $decoratedController) { $this-\u0026gt;decoratedController = $decoratedController; } public function indexAction(CmsPageCategoryFilters $categoryFilters, CmsPageFilters $cmsFilters, Request $request) { return $this-\u0026gt;decoratedController-\u0026gt;indexAction($categoryFilters, $cmsFilters, $request); } } In this example we do nothing more than returning the exact output from the decorated controller. However we could modify the input request or the output given by decorated controller before returning it. Example:\n\u0026lt;?php public function indexAction(CmsPageCategoryFilters $categoryFilters, CmsPageFilters $cmsFilters, Request $request) { $output = $this-\u0026gt;decoratedController-\u0026gt;indexAction($categoryFilters, $cmsFilters, $request); $myService = $this-\u0026gt;getMyPaymentService(); $output = $this-\u0026gt;injectMyData($myService, $output); return $output; }  If you have trouble writing the right service configuration for your decoration, you can use Symfony debugger to dump the routes with php bin/console debug:container.

	"content": "Overriding modules When you write a theme, you often need to override the templates and assets coming from a module so that they match your theme\u0026rsquo;s specific markup needs. Themes can override modules' assets (CSS and JavaScript only) by placing the corresponding file at a specific location.\nWith PrestaShop 1.7, all module overriding code goes to the modules directory (in your module\u0026rsquo;s own directory). Every PS 1.7 module developer should be aware of this change (introduced with PR 5020: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/5020).\nIf your asset override is empty, PrestaShop will load nothing (neither the module one nor your override). This is useful if you want to fully remove this module style and add your own to your compiled theme.css. Examples in this page are based on this sample module directory structure:\n. ├── css │ ├── external-lib.css │ └── style.css ├── js │ └── app.js ├── moduledemo.php └── views └── templates └── front ├── included-template.tpl └── moduledemo.tpl 5 directories, 6 files Overriding templates and assets With PrestaShop 1.7, here are the folder paths to create in order to override templates and assets:\n. └── modules ├── css │ ├── external-lib.css │ └── style.css ├── js │ └── app.js └── views └── templates └── front ├── included-template.tpl └── moduledemo.tpl 6 directories, 5 files Compared to what was needed in PrestaShop 1.6, it is much simpler:\n. ├── css │ └── modules │ └── css │ ├── external-lib.css │ └── style.css ├── js │ └── modules │ └── js │ └── app.js └── modules └── views └── templates └── front ├── included-template.tpl └── moduledemo.tpl 10 directories, 5 files Overriding with the \u0026lsquo;include\u0026rsquo; method There is one very important issue that you should be aware of. When loading a template file (for instance \u0026lsquo;moduledemo.tpl\u0026rsquo;), PrestaShop will look for overriding first, in the following order:\n /themes/THEME_NAME/modules/MODULE_NAME/views/templates/front/moduledemo.tpl /modules/MODULE_NAME/views/templates/front/moduledemo.tpl  But if your moduledemo.tpl file includes the included-template.tpl file, you will have to override \u0026lsquo;included-template.tpl\u0026rsquo; as well, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to modify it (nor to edit the path). This means that every file that an overridden file includes needs to be copy-pasted as-is in order for your override to work properly.\nThe issue goes both ways: if you want to modify the included-template.tpl file, you will have to override the moduledemo.tpl file that includes it.\n{include file=\u0026#39;./included-template.tpl\u0026#39;}PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new cool way to include files in module templates. By using this method, all the expected rules will be followed:\n{include file=\u0026#39;module:MODULE_NAME/views/templates/front/included-template.tpl\u0026#39;}SmartyDev helps you debug! PrestaShop 1.7 also introduces our own SmartyDev tool, an Smarty extension which allows you to see the template\u0026rsquo;s name within your generated HTML markup. This will help debugging a lot, especially because of template override.\nHere an example of generated markup with SmartyDev activated:\n[...] \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/en/\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;dropdown-item\u0026#34;\u0026gt;English\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- end /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blocklanguages/blocklanguages.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- begin /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blockuserinfo/blockuserinfo.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;user-info\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;material-icons _gray-darker\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#xE7FF;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;logout\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/fr/?mylogout=\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;nofollow\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Me déconnecter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Déconnexion\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;account\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/fr/mon-compte\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Voir mon compte client\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;nofollow\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Julien Bourdeau\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- end /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blockuserinfo/blockuserinfo.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- begin /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blockcart/blockcart.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;blockcart cart-preview \u0026#34; data-refresh-url=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/fr/module/blockcart/ajax\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a rel=\u0026#34;nofollow\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;cart\u0026#34;\u0026gt; [...] To use it, simply set the _PS_MODE_DEV_ constant to true in your installation\u0026rsquo;s /config/defines.inc.php file: add the define('_PS_MODE_DEV_', true); line to that file in order to turn the PrestaShop Developer Mode on, which features SmartyDev.\n"

When loading a template file (for instance \u0026lsquo;moduledemo.tpl\u0026rsquo;), PrestaShop will look for overriding first, in the following order:\n /themes/THEME_NAME/modules/MODULE_NAME/views/templates/front/moduledemo.tpl /modules/MODULE_NAME/views/templates/front/moduledemo.tpl  But if your moduledemo.tpl file includes the included-template.tpl file, you will have to override \u0026lsquo;included-template.tpl\u0026rsquo; as well, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to modify it (nor to edit the path). This means that every file that an overridden file includes needs to be copy-pasted as-is in order for your override to work properly.\nThe issue goes both ways: if you want to modify the included-template.tpl file, you will have to override the moduledemo.tpl file that includes it.\n{include file=\u0026#39;./included-template.tpl\u0026#39;}PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new cool way to include files in module templates. By using this method, all the expected rules will be followed:\n{include file=\u0026#39;module:MODULE_NAME/views/templates/front/included-template.tpl\u0026#39;}SmartyDev helps you debug! PrestaShop 1.7 also introduces our own SmartyDev tool, an Smarty extension which allows you to see the template\u0026rsquo;s name within your generated HTML markup. This will help debugging a lot, especially because of template override.\nHere an example of generated markup with SmartyDev activated:\n[...] \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/en/\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;dropdown-item\u0026#34;\u0026gt;English\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- end /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blocklanguages/blocklanguages.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- begin /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blockuserinfo/blockuserinfo.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;user-info\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;material-icons _gray-darker\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#xE7FF;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;logout\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/fr/?mylogout=\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;nofollow\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Me déconnecter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Déconnexion\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;account\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/fr/mon-compte\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Voir mon compte client\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;nofollow\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Julien Bourdeau\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- end /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blockuserinfo/blockuserinfo.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- begin /Users/julien/Sites/PrestaShop/themes/classic/modules/blockcart/blockcart.tpl --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;blockcart cart-preview \u0026#34; data-refresh-url=\u0026#34;http://prestashop.ps/fr/module/blockcart/ajax\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a rel=\u0026#34;nofollow\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;cart\u0026#34;\u0026gt; [...] To use it, simply set the _PS_MODE_DEV_ constant to true in your installation\u0026rsquo;s /config/defines.inc.php file: add the define('_PS_MODE_DEV_', true); line to that file in order to turn the PrestaShop Developer Mode on, which features SmartyDev.\n"

In order to update currency exchange rates regularly, you need to setup an automatic task that execute Currency::refreshCurrencies() regularly.\nTo help you do so, a script cron_currency_rates.php exists in your admin directory.\nBuild the URL to call the script This script can be triggered by a webserver if you hit the right URL. The admin directory is different for every shop so you need to use your own admin folder name.\nYou also need to provide an authentication secure_key.\nIn order to obtain this secure key, you need 2 items:\n the _COOKIE_KEY_ of your shop that you can find in app/config/parameters.php your shop name  The secure key is computed like this:\n$secureKey = md5(_COOKIE_KEY_ .

You now need to setup an automatic task that send HTTP requests regularly.\nA popular way to do it is to rely on a crontab.

	"content": "RTL support PrestaShop supports RTL (Right-to-left) themes natively.\nRTL stylesheets There are two ways of customizing your theme for RTL: either by adding an override file that is only loaded for RTL languages, or by using completely different version of the theme\u0026rsquo;s stylesheets.\nCSS override file PrestaShop will try to load a css file named rtl.css after your theme\u0026rsquo;s ones when displayed in an RTL language.

Some variables coming from the controller might need to be passed to this function.\nSo far, it is only used for forms (customer information and checkout).\n{render file=\u0026#34;customer/_partials/login-form.tpl\u0026#34; ui=$login_form}{url} PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new Smarty helper to generate URLs. This will take care of SSL, domain name, virtual and physical base URI, parameters concatenation, and of course URL rewriting.\n{url} uses the Link class internally.\nPlease see the $urls dataset to find already regenerated urls (such as home, cart, login and so on). While an instance of the Link object is still present in templates for backward compatibility purposes, it is strongly recommended not to use it. Use {url} instead. Here is a few examples:\n{url entity=address id=$id_address}{url entity=address params=[\u0026#39;id_address\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $id_address]}{url entity=address id=$id_address params=[\u0026#39;delete\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1]}{url entity=\u0026#39;sf\u0026#39; route=\u0026#39;admin_module_manage\u0026#39; sf-params=[\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;]}\u0026hellip;will respectively output:\nhttp://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3 http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3 http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3\u0026amp;delete=1 http://prestashop.ps/it/admin/module/manage Widgets PrestaShop 1.7 introduced a new way to display modules in a theme, called Widgets. Instead of using a hook and hooking your module to it, the widget functions allow you explicitly manipulate your module from a template.\nAvoid using this feature if you can.\nWhile this can be useful in some situations, it effectively couples your template to a module, which is not a good practice. Use it with care.\n {widget} This function lets you display content from the module in your template.\nHere is an example from classic theme, it displays the shop contact details wherever you want.\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;sidebar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {widget name=\u0026#34;ps_contactinfo\u0026#34;}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Since the module may have a different behavior depending on which hook they are hooked on, you can pass the hook name.\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;footer\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {widget name=\u0026#34;ps_contactinfo\u0026#34; hook=\u0026#34;displayFooter\u0026#34;}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {widget_block} Even better, you can rewrite the template on the go. The module will use your Smarty code instead of loading the template file.\nTaking the Link list module as an example. Instead of redefining ps_linklist/views/templates/hook/linkblock.tpl (source), you can override it this way:\n{widget_block name=\u0026#34;ps_linklist\u0026#34;}{foreach $linkBlocks as $linkBlock}\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; {foreach $linkBlock.links as $link}\u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$link.url}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{$link.title}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{$link.description}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {/foreach}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; {/foreach}{/widget_block}Modifiers Class name modifiers In order to use the data from controller to generate class names, we added 2 modifiers: classname and classnames.\nclassname The classname data modifier will ensure that your string is a valid class name.\nIt will:\n Put it in lowercase. Replace any non-ASCII characters (such as accented characters) with their ASCII equivalent (see the code here ). Replace all non-alphanumerical characters with a single dash. Ensure only one consecutive dash is used.  {assign var=attr value=\u0026#39;Hérè-Is_a-Clàssnåme--@#$$ˆ*(\u0026amp;-----\u0026#39;}{$attr|classname}\u0026hellip;will output:\nhere-is-a-classname-v classnames This data modifier takes an array, where the key is the class name and the value is a boolean indicating if it should be outputted or not.\nNote that each class name is passed through the classname modifier.\n\u0026lt;?php $body_classes = [ \u0026#34;lang-fr\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;rtl\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; false, \u0026#34;country-FR\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;currency-EUR\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;layout-full-width\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;page-index\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, ]; This way, this Smarty code:\n\u0026lt;body class=\u0026#34;{$page.body_classes|classnames}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026hellip;will generate:\n\u0026lt;body class=\u0026#34;lang-fr country-fr currency-eur layout-full-width page-index\u0026#34;\u0026gt; "

Doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when d is present.    Here are some examples:\n{l s=\u0026#34;This is a text\u0026#34; d=\u0026#34;Admin.Shipping.Feature\u0026#34;}{l s=\u0026#34;This is a text with a %s\u0026#34; d=\u0026#34;Admin.Shipping.Feature\u0026#34; sprintf=[$replacement]}{l s=\u0026#34;This is a legacy text\u0026#34; mod=\u0026#34;somemodule\u0026#34;}If you need to escape quotes in the translated text, do it like this:\n\u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34;\u0026gt; var thisIsAString = \u0026#39;{l|escape:\u0026#34;javascript\u0026#34; s=\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t do this at home\u0026#34; d=\u0026#34;Modules.Mymodule\u0026#34;}\u0026#39;; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {render} This function renders the specified template. Some variables coming from the controller might need to be passed to this function.\nSo far, it is only used for forms (customer information and checkout).\n{render file=\u0026#34;customer/_partials/login-form.tpl\u0026#34; ui=$login_form}{url} PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new Smarty helper to generate URLs. This will take care of SSL, domain name, virtual and physical base URI, parameters concatenation, and of course URL rewriting.\n{url} uses the Link class internally.\nPlease see the $urls dataset to find already regenerated urls (such as home, cart, login and so on). While an instance of the Link object is still present in templates for backward compatibility purposes, it is strongly recommended not to use it. Use {url} instead. Here is a few examples:\n{url entity=address id=$id_address}{url entity=address params=[\u0026#39;id_address\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $id_address]}{url entity=address id=$id_address params=[\u0026#39;delete\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1]}{url entity=\u0026#39;sf\u0026#39; route=\u0026#39;admin_module_manage\u0026#39; sf-params=[\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;]}\u0026hellip;will respectively output:\nhttp://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3 http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3 http://prestashop.ps/it/address?id_address=3\u0026amp;delete=1 http://prestashop.ps/it/admin/module/manage Widgets PrestaShop 1.7 introduced a new way to display modules in a theme, called Widgets. Instead of using a hook and hooking your module to it, the widget functions allow you explicitly manipulate your module from a template.\nAvoid using this feature if you can.\nWhile this can be useful in some situations, it effectively couples your template to a module, which is not a good practice. Use it with care.\n {widget} This function lets you display content from the module in your template.\nHere is an example from classic theme, it displays the shop contact details wherever you want.\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;sidebar\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {widget name=\u0026#34;ps_contactinfo\u0026#34;}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Since the module may have a different behavior depending on which hook they are hooked on, you can pass the hook name.\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;footer\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {widget name=\u0026#34;ps_contactinfo\u0026#34; hook=\u0026#34;displayFooter\u0026#34;}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {widget_block} Even better, you can rewrite the template on the go. The module will use your Smarty code instead of loading the template file.\nTaking the Link list module as an example. Instead of redefining ps_linklist/views/templates/hook/linkblock.tpl (source), you can override it this way:\n{widget_block name=\u0026#34;ps_linklist\u0026#34;}{foreach $linkBlocks as $linkBlock}\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; {foreach $linkBlock.links as $link}\u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{$link.url}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{$link.title}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{$link.description}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {/foreach}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; {/foreach}{/widget_block}Modifiers Class name modifiers In order to use the data from controller to generate class names, we added 2 modifiers: classname and classnames.\nclassname The classname data modifier will ensure that your string is a valid class name.\nIt will:\n Put it in lowercase. Replace any non-ASCII characters (such as accented characters) with their ASCII equivalent (see the code here ). Replace all non-alphanumerical characters with a single dash. Ensure only one consecutive dash is used.  {assign var=attr value=\u0026#39;Hérè-Is_a-Clàssnåme--@#$$ˆ*(\u0026amp;-----\u0026#39;}{$attr|classname}\u0026hellip;will output:\nhere-is-a-classname-v classnames This data modifier takes an array, where the key is the class name and the value is a boolean indicating if it should be outputted or not.\nNote that each class name is passed through the classname modifier.\n\u0026lt;?php $body_classes = [ \u0026#34;lang-fr\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;rtl\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; false, \u0026#34;country-FR\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;currency-EUR\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;layout-full-width\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#34;page-index\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; true, ]; This way, this Smarty code:\n\u0026lt;body class=\u0026#34;{$page.body_classes|classnames}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026hellip;will generate:\n\u0026lt;body class=\u0026#34;lang-fr country-fr currency-eur layout-full-width page-index\u0026#34;\u0026gt; "

	"content": "Stock FAQ  StockAvailable StockMovement  Q: Where exactly can I find the stock of a specified product?\nA: All the stock information for every Product (and Combination) is stored in the StockAvailable entity/table. You will find duplicate values in Product and Combination object via their quantity fields, but they are deprecated fields that are only kept for backward compatibility and will be removed in future versions. The only true source of information for stock data is StockAvailable.\nStockAvailable Q: What does the StockAvailable contain exactly?\nA: Each StockAvailable is associated to a Product or a Combination, and if you are using the multi shop feature you can also have different stock for each Shop or Shop group. Here are the details of each field:\n   Field Description     quantity The remaining available quantity. This indicates how many products can still be sold in the shop. This is what the user will see on the FO if enabled. It\u0026rsquo;s also the quantity you can see on the BO\u0026rsquo;s product page.   physical_quantity The actual quantity that you have in your physical stock, in your shelves. It might be different from quantity when an Order has been purchased but is not paid, or shipped yet (see reserved_quantity).   reserved_quantity This indicates how many items from your physical quantity are currently reserved for your pending orders. The product has been bought by a customer but is still in your inventory, either because the order is awaiting payment or the package has not yet been sent.   out_of_stock This is the configuration defining how you want to handle this product in the FO when it is out of stock (available stock is too low). use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Product\\Stock\\ValueObject\\OutOfStockType; OutOfStockType::OUT_OF_STOCK_NOT_AVAILABLE = 0; // Not available when out of stock OutOfStockType::OUT_OF_STOCK_AVAILABLE = 1; // Available when out of stock OutOfStockType::OUT_OF_STOCK_DEFAULT = 2; // Use default configuration    location The location where the product is stored, to help the merchant handle their storage and prepare their packages.   depends_on_stock Deprecated It was used for advanced stock management in previous versions, but is no longer used.    You will probably notice that usually physical_quantity = available_quantity + reserved_quantity; To avoid confusion, from now on we will refer to StockAvailable::quantity as virtual quantity. Q: When is the StockAvailable object/table updated?\nA: That\u0026rsquo;s a broad question but basically for any action that should logically have an impact on the stock. When a product quantity is modified in BO, when an order is created, when the order is delivered, \u0026hellip; However, here is a little chronology of stock quantities during a full checkout process:\n   Scenario Step virtual_quantity physical_quantity reserved_quantity Side note     Great Product is created in the BO with a virtual quantity of 50 50 50 0    A customer decides to add 3 Great Product into their cart 50 50 0 For now the product is only in a cart, nothing is reserved, anyone can still buy one of the 50 remaining products.   The customer goes through the whole checkout process and chooses to pay by check. 47 50 3 The order has been created, but the payment is not accepted yet. Virtual quantity and reserved quantity are updated.   A few days later, the merchant receives the check, so they change the Order status to Payment accepted 47 50 3 The product is now paid, but the package has still not been prepared.   The package is prepared and delivered to a Carrier, the order status is switched to Delivered or Shipped 47 47 0 The product is no longer reserved, it has actually been sent to the customer. So reserved and physical quantities can be decreased.    Q: Where can I see and modify my Stock?\nA: Although you can change the quantity directly on your product page, we strongly recommend using the Catalog \u0026gt; Stock section in your BO because it is based on StockMovement which is safer than a direct edition (read below why).\nQ: Can I edit the physical or reserved quantity myself or using an ERP?\nA: Avoid doing this! These two fields should be considered read-only and exist for performance reasons. They are automatically recomputed every time the stock is synchronized:\n reserved_quantity is the sum of each quantity in pending orders:\nreserved_quantity_per_order = SUM(order_detail.product_quantity - order_detail.product_quantity_refunded) physical_quantity is recalculated after the reserved quantity is updated:\nphysical_quantity = virtual_quantity + reserved_quantity  So in the end the only important field is the virtual quantity (StockAvailable::quantity), the other two fields are handled by the core. You should avoid modifying them.\nStockMovement Q: What is a StockMovement? What is the difference with direct edition?\nA: When you edit the virtual quantity of a Product you are going to edit the StockAvailable::quantity field directly in your database. When you modify your stock through a StockMovement you apply a delta to your existing stock.\nQ: What is the advantage of delta edition vs direct edition?\nA: When you edit the virtual quantity directly, the value is saved in database, but you cannot be sure that there was no modification in stock between the moment you opened your Product page, and the moment you saved the new value. Imagine this scenario:\n You have 50 items of Great Product on stock. It is your best-seller, so today you are expecting a delivery to increase your stock. You get 50 new products and want to update the stock from the Product page. You open the page indicating that you have 50 products left in your stock. While you are checking this stock, since it is your best-seller, three items have been sold and shipped, so your stock is now actually 47, not 50. You update your expected stock from 50 to 100 and save the product. Your stock now shows 100 products, while it should have been 97 (50 - 3 + 50)  That is why a StockMovement is safer: it will not change your stock to 100, but add 50 to your current stock level instead. This way, even if the stock changes without your knowledge, the final value will remain correct.\nQ: Are there any other advantages to use StockMovement?\nA: Another advantage is that every operation (or StockMovement) registers a log in the database. This provides you with a complete history of the stock evolution for the product, including useful details:\n what was the reason for the movement which order or which employee performed the action when did it happen \u0026hellip;  You can access this history in the Catalog \u0026gt; Stock \u0026gt; Movements section from your BO.\n"

You will find duplicate values in Product and Combination object via their quantity fields, but they are deprecated fields that are only kept for backward compatibility and will be removed in future versions. The only true source of information for stock data is StockAvailable.\nStockAvailable Q: What does the StockAvailable contain exactly?\nA: Each StockAvailable is associated to a Product or a Combination, and if you are using the multi shop feature you can also have different stock for each Shop or Shop group. Here are the details of each field:\n   Field Description     quantity The remaining available quantity. This indicates how many products can still be sold in the shop. This is what the user will see on the FO if enabled. It\u0026rsquo;s also the quantity you can see on the BO\u0026rsquo;s product page.   physical_quantity The actual quantity that you have in your physical stock, in your shelves. It might be different from quantity when an Order has been purchased but is not paid, or shipped yet (see reserved_quantity).   reserved_quantity This indicates how many items from your physical quantity are currently reserved for your pending orders. The product has been bought by a customer but is still in your inventory, either because the order is awaiting payment or the package has not yet been sent.   out_of_stock This is the configuration defining how you want to handle this product in the FO when it is out of stock (available stock is too low). use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Domain\\Product\\Stock\\ValueObject\\OutOfStockType; OutOfStockType::OUT_OF_STOCK_NOT_AVAILABLE = 0; // Not available when out of stock OutOfStockType::OUT_OF_STOCK_AVAILABLE = 1; // Available when out of stock OutOfStockType::OUT_OF_STOCK_DEFAULT = 2; // Use default configuration    location The location where the product is stored, to help the merchant handle their storage and prepare their packages.   depends_on_stock Deprecated It was used for advanced stock management in previous versions, but is no longer used.    You will probably notice that usually physical_quantity = available_quantity + reserved_quantity; To avoid confusion, from now on we will refer to StockAvailable::quantity as virtual quantity. Q: When is the StockAvailable object/table updated?\nA: That\u0026rsquo;s a broad question but basically for any action that should logically have an impact on the stock. When a product quantity is modified in BO, when an order is created, when the order is delivered, \u0026hellip; However, here is a little chronology of stock quantities during a full checkout process:\n   Scenario Step virtual_quantity physical_quantity reserved_quantity Side note     Great Product is created in the BO with a virtual quantity of 50 50 50 0    A customer decides to add 3 Great Product into their cart 50 50 0 For now the product is only in a cart, nothing is reserved, anyone can still buy one of the 50 remaining products.   The customer goes through the whole checkout process and chooses to pay by check. 47 50 3 The order has been created, but the payment is not accepted yet. Virtual quantity and reserved quantity are updated.   A few days later, the merchant receives the check, so they change the Order status to Payment accepted 47 50 3 The product is now paid, but the package has still not been prepared.   The package is prepared and delivered to a Carrier, the order status is switched to Delivered or Shipped 47 47 0 The product is no longer reserved, it has actually been sent to the customer. So reserved and physical quantities can be decreased.    Q: Where can I see and modify my Stock?\nA: Although you can change the quantity directly on your product page, we strongly recommend using the Catalog \u0026gt; Stock section in your BO because it is based on StockMovement which is safer than a direct edition (read below why).\nQ: Can I edit the physical or reserved quantity myself or using an ERP?\nA: Avoid doing this! These two fields should be considered read-only and exist for performance reasons. They are automatically recomputed every time the stock is synchronized:\n reserved_quantity is the sum of each quantity in pending orders:\nreserved_quantity_per_order = SUM(order_detail.product_quantity - order_detail.product_quantity_refunded) physical_quantity is recalculated after the reserved quantity is updated:\nphysical_quantity = virtual_quantity + reserved_quantity  So in the end the only important field is the virtual quantity (StockAvailable::quantity), the other two fields are handled by the core. You should avoid modifying them.\nStockMovement Q: What is a StockMovement? What is the difference with direct edition?\nA: When you edit the virtual quantity of a Product you are going to edit the StockAvailable::quantity field directly in your database. When you modify your stock through a StockMovement you apply a delta to your existing stock.\nQ: What is the advantage of delta edition vs direct edition?\nA: When you edit the virtual quantity directly, the value is saved in database, but you cannot be sure that there was no modification in stock between the moment you opened your Product page, and the moment you saved the new value. Imagine this scenario:\n You have 50 items of Great Product on stock. It is your best-seller, so today you are expecting a delivery to increase your stock. You get 50 new products and want to update the stock from the Product page. You open the page indicating that you have 50 products left in your stock. While you are checking this stock, since it is your best-seller, three items have been sold and shipped, so your stock is now actually 47, not 50. You update your expected stock from 50 to 100 and save the product. Your stock now shows 100 products, while it should have been 97 (50 - 3 + 50)  That is why a StockMovement is safer: it will not change your stock to 100, but add 50 to your current stock level instead. This way, even if the stock changes without your knowledge, the final value will remain correct.\nQ: Are there any other advantages to use StockMovement?\nA: Another advantage is that every operation (or StockMovement) registers a log in the database. This provides you with a complete history of the stock evolution for the product, including useful details:\n what was the reason for the movement which order or which employee performed the action when did it happen \u0026hellip;  You can access this history in the Catalog \u0026gt; Stock \u0026gt; Movements section from your BO.\n"

	"content": "Symfony controllers \u0026amp; routing Read the Symfony documentation on Controllers and Routing. Controllers are located in src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin folder. Starting on 1.7.3, controllers are being progressively organized in sub-folders following the Back Office menu. For instance, the TaxController is located in src/PrestaShop/Controller/Admin/Improve/International. Same applies to Improve, Sell sections etc.\nThis is how the directory tree of controllers should look like:\nController/ └── Admin ├── Configure │ ├── AdvancedParameters │ └── ShopParameters ├── Improve │ ├── Design │ ├── International │ ├── Modules │ ├── Payment │ └── Shipping └── Sell ├── Catalog ├── Customers ├── CustomerService ├── Orders └── Stats Symfony Controllers should be thin by default and have only one responsibility: getting the HTTP Request from the client and returning an HTTP Response. This means that every business logic should be placed in dedicated classes outside the Controller:\n Form management Database access Validation etc\u0026hellip;  You can take a look at PerformanceController for an example of good implementation, and ProductController for something you should avoid at all costs.\nNever, ever call the legacy controller inside the new controller. It\u0026rsquo;s a no go, no matter the reason! Controllers are responsible for performing \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo;. Actions are methods of Controllers which mapped to a route, and that return a Response. Regarding the rendering of a Response, there is some data specific to PrestaShop (in Back Office) that we must set for every action:\n   Attribute Type Description     layoutHeaderToolbarBtn [[\u0026lsquo;href\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;des\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;icon\u0026rsquo;], \u0026hellip;] Set buttons in toolbar on top of the page   layoutTitle string Main title of the page   requireAddonsSearch boolean If true, display addons recommendations button   requireBulkActions boolean If true, display bulk actions button   showContentHeader boolean If true, display the page header   enableSidebar boolean If true, display a sidebar   help_link string Set the url of \u0026ldquo;Help\u0026rdquo; button   requireFilterStatus boolean ??? (Specific to Modules page?)   level integer Level of authorization for actions (Specific to modules)    Controller Helpers Some helpers are specific to PrestaShop to help you manage the security and the dispatching of legacy hooks, all of them are directly available in Controllers that extends FrameworkBundleAdminController.\n isDemoModeEnabled(): some actions should not be allowed in Demonstration Mode getDemoErrorMessage(): returns a specific error message addFlash(type, msg): accepts \u0026ldquo;success|error\u0026rdquo; and a message that will be displayed after redirection of the page flashErrors([msgs]): if you need to \u0026ldquo;flash\u0026rdquo; a collection of errors dispatchHook(hookName, [params]): some legacy hooks need to be dispatched to preserve backward compatibility authorizationLevel(controllerName): check if you are allowed - as connected user - to do the related actions langToLocale($lang): get the locale from a PrestaShop lang trans(key, domain, [params]): translate a string redirectToDefaultPage(): redirect the user to the configurated default page presentGrid(GridInterface $grid): returns an instance of Grid view getCommandBus: returns the Command bus getQueryBus: returns the Query bus  Security In modern pages, the permissions system that checks if a user is allowed to do CRUD actions has been improved.\nPrestaShop allows merchants to choose which actions (like CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) can be done by each user profile on each resource (like \u0026ldquo;Product\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;User\u0026rdquo;). In PrestaShop Back Office, most of these resources are managed by only one Controller, so rights are handled on a page-per-page basis instead of by resource.\nSo if a logged user wants to manipulate a resource, he or she needs to have the correct rights on the appropriate controller. For instance, to be able to access the \u0026ldquo;Product Catalog\u0026rdquo; page the user need READ access, because showing the page requires \u0026ldquo;reading\u0026rdquo; the Product information. If the user wants to delete a product, (s)he needs DELETE rights.\nTo enforce this security policy, you have to set up the adequate checks for each one of the actions of your controller. Policies are declared as annotations on top of every controller Action method:\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShopBundle\\Security\\Annotation\\AdminSecurity; class SomeController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { /** * @AdminSecurity( * \u0026#34;is_granted([\u0026#39;read\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;create\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;delete\u0026#39;], request.get(\u0026#39;_legacy_controller\u0026#39;))\u0026#34;, * message=\u0026#34;You do not have permission to update this.\u0026#34;, * redirectRoute=\u0026#34;some_route_name\u0026#34; * ) * */ public function fooAction(Request $request) { // action code  } } Access rules convention The following access rules must be enforced:\n indexAction requires READ permission and only this one createAction which allows to create an item, requires CREATE permission editAction which allows to update an item, requires UPDATE permission deleteAction which allows to delete an item, requires DELETE permission  Moreover, if one page allows to modify some prestashop settings, this action can be used by users who are granted either CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE permissions.\nHow does this work? The AdminSecurity annotation will check if the logged user is granted to access the Action (ie. to the URL). This annotation has 5 properties:\n  The first argument is an evaluated expression that must return a boolean. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re checking if the user has all the rights on the current Controller.\nAs explained before, access rights (\u0026ldquo;roles\u0026rdquo;) in PrestaShop are managed by action (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and related controller. Since roles are currently managed by the legacy system using the legacy controller names, you need to provide the name of the legacy controller to the security system.\n  The _legacy_controller parameter is explained below in the “Routing in PrestaShop” section.   message - (optional) Contains the error message displayed to the user, if (s)he\u0026rsquo;s not allowed to perform the action.\n  redirectRoute - (optional) Route name the router will use to redirect the user if (s)he\u0026rsquo;s not allowed to perform the action.\n  domain - (optional) Describes the translation domain for the message.\n  url - (optional) Used to configure an URL for redirection instead of relying on the router.\n  This property is temporary and will be removed once the Dashboard has been migrated to Symfony.\nIf you use both url and redirectRoute at the same time, redirectRoute will win!  Demo Mode PrestaShop is provided with a Demo Mode that, when enabled, defines access application-wide rights that override whatever rights the current user may have. In other words, something that is disabled in Demo Mode will be disabled for all users, even if that user would normally have access to it.\nThe demo mode can be enabled by setting _PS_MODE_DEMO_ to true in config/defines.inc.php. When an action needs to be restricted in Demo Mode, you can use the DemoRestricted annotation:\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShopBundle\\Security\\Annotation\\DemoRestricted; /** * @DemoRestricted(\u0026#34;route_to_be_redirected\u0026#34;, * message=\u0026#34;You can\u0026#39;t do this when demo mode is enabled.\u0026#34;, * domain=\u0026#34;Admin.Global\u0026#34; * ) * */ public function fooAction(Request $request) { // do something here }  message and domain are both optional. Dynamic restrictions Sometimes, it may be necessary to dynamically decide on restrictions (eg. depending on user input or an action performed). In addition, it may happen that a Controller action has to handle both the update and display of a resource. What if we want to allow the READ action but not the UPDATE?\nIn this case, you can use the Controllers helper functions we described above: isDemoModeEnabled() and authorizationLevel().\nRouting in PrestaShop Routes are responsible for mapping a controller action to an url, you can read more about routing in symfony docs.\nPrestaShop uses YAML files for service declaration and routing (NOT ANNOTATIONS). Routes are declared in src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/admin folder, following the menu organization.\nThe routing is organized as follows:\n. ├── admin │ ├── _common.yml │ ├── configure │ │ ├── advanced_parameters │ │ ├── _configure.yml │ │ └── shop_parameters │ ├── improve │ │ ├── design │ │ ├── _improve.yml │ │ ├── international │ │ ├── modules │ │ ├── payment │ │ └── shipping │ ├── _security.yml │ └── sell │ ├── catalog │ ├── orders │ ├── _sell.yml │ └── stocks.yml ├── admin.yml ├── api │ ├── attributes.yml │ ├── categories.yml │ ├── features.yml │ ├── i18n.yml │ ├── improve │ │ └── design │ ├── manufacturers.yml │ ├── stock_movements.yml │ ├── stocks.yml │ ├── suppliers.yml │ └── translations.yml └── api.yml Property _legacy_controller contains the old name of the related controller. The _legacy_link keeps a link between legacy urls and new ones (when going to a page using old link it will redirect to the new one instead).\nProperty _legacy_controller allows to map a Symfony controller name to a legacy controller name. Many components in PrestaShop rely on a legacy controller name. Examples: Security restrictions, menu items management, or the collapsable help right sidebar. For example, this is how the \u0026ldquo;Configure \u0026gt; Advanced Parameters -\u0026gt; System Information\u0026rdquo; page route configuration looks like:\nadmin_system_information:path:system_informationmethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Admin\\AdvancedParameters\\SystemInformationController::indexAction\u0026#39;_legacy_controller:AdminInformation_legacy_link:AdminInformation PrestaShop uses YAML files for service declaration and routing Routing configuration route_name:path:some/urlmethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Path\\To\\ControllerClass::{actionName}Action\u0026#39;_legacy_controller:LegacyController_legacy_link:{LegacyController}:{actionName}# In some cases several controllers/actions are managed by the same migrated controller# You have the possibility to set an array as _legacy_link thus preventing you from defining alias routesother_route_name:path:some/other/urlmethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle\\Controller\\Path\\To\\Other\\ControllerClass::{actionName}Action\u0026#39;_legacy_controller:LegacyController_legacy_link:- {LegacyController}:{actionName}- {LegacyController}:{aliasActionName} The actionName part is optional for the index action (equivalent to list), therefore these three notations are equivalent:\nadmin_emails:path:/emailsmethods:[GET]defaults:_controller:\u0026#39;PrestaShopBundle:Admin\\Configure\\AdvancedParameters\\Email:index\u0026#39;_legacy_controller:AdminEmails_legacy_link:- AdminEmails- AdminEmails:index- AdminEmails:listAutomatic redirection Finally some urls might have been generated manually or hard coded. To avoid losing these legacy urls a Symfony listener checks each call to the back office and tries to match it to a migrated url if it is found then the response is automatically redirected to the new migrated url.\nadmin/index.php?controller=AdminPaymentPreferences =\u0026gt; Redirected to /admin/preferences admin/index.php?controller=AdminPaymentPreferences\u0026amp;action=update =\u0026gt; Redirected to /admin/preferences/update admin/index.php?controller=AdminPaymentPreferences\u0026amp;action=export =\u0026gt; No redirection, the legacy controller is called Javascript generation In order to avoid hardcoded links in JavaScript, Prestashop uses the Router component.\n"

	"content": "Symfony controllers \u0026amp; routing Read the Symfony documentation on Controllers and Routing. Controllers are located in src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin folder. Starting on 1.7.3, controllers are being progressively organized in sub-folders following the Back Office menu. For instance, the TaxController is located in src/PrestaShop/Controller/Admin/Improve/International. Same applies to Improve, Sell sections etc.\nThis is how the directory tree of controllers should look like:\nController/ └── Admin ├── Configure │ ├── AdvancedParameters │ └── ShopParameters ├── Improve │ ├── Design │ ├── International │ ├── Modules │ ├── Payment │ └── Shipping └── Sell ├── Catalog ├── Customers ├── CustomerService ├── Orders └── Stats Symfony Controllers should be thin by default and have only one responsibility: getting the HTTP Request from the client and returning an HTTP Response. This means that every business logic should be placed in dedicated classes outside the Controller:\n Form management Database access Validation etc\u0026hellip;  You can take a look at PerformanceController for an example of good implementation, and ProductController for something you should avoid at all costs.\nNever, ever call the legacy controller inside the new controller.

	"content": "Template inheritance PrestaShop 1.7 relies a lot on template inheritance in order to create the most consistant theme possible while heavily reducing the amount of duplicated code.\nThe principle Template inheritance allow you to extend a parent template and only redefine the block you need.\nThe picture below illustrates the example of a specific product page extending a generic one. Say you have three files: product-pack.tpl extending product.tpl, itself extending page.tpl.\n Schema for template inheritance   The product-pack.tpl file will only contain the product description part. Everything else will be exactly the same as product page. Even better, the product page will only define the main content of the page, everything else will be taken from its own parent template (ie page.tpl).\nThe wrong way of doing this would be to extract header, footer and reusable part of the template and include them in each file.\nThe official Smarty documentation has a nice and simple example. In their own words:\n Template inheritance is an approach to managing templates that resembles object-oriented programming techniques. Instead of the traditional use of {include \u0026hellip;} tags to manage parts of templates, you can inherit the contents of one template to another (like extending a class) and change blocks of content therein (like overriding methods of a class.) This keeps template management minimal and efficient, since each template only contains the differences from the template it extends.\n PrestaShop real life example In a PrestaShop theme, many pages are very similar, for example template listing products: categories, new products, search results, and so on. All of them display a list of products so in PS 1.7 they all extend catalog/listing/product-list.tpl (which extends the main layout).\n{extends file=$layout}{block name=\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;section id=\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {block name=\u0026#39;product_list_header\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;h2 class=\u0026#34;h2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{$listing.label}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {/block}{block name=\u0026#39;product_list\u0026#39;}{include file=\u0026#39;catalog/_partials/products.tpl\u0026#39; listing=$listing}{/block}\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; {/block}The template will show a title and a list of products underneath. For category page, we want a nice description with an cover image. So we can simply override the product_list_header\n{extends file=\u0026#39;catalog/listing/product-list.tpl\u0026#39;}{block name=\u0026#39;product_list_header\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{$category.name}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;category-cover\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;{$category.image.large.url}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;{$category.image.legend}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;category-description\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{$category.description nofilter}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {/block}This reduce code to the minimum, without any repetition.\n"

So we can simply override the product_list_header\n{extends file=\u0026#39;catalog/listing/product-list.tpl\u0026#39;}{block name=\u0026#39;product_list_header\u0026#39;}\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{$category.name}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;category-cover\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;{$category.image.large.url}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;{$category.image.legend}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;category-description\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{$category.description nofilter}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {/block}This reduce code to the minimum, without any repetition.\n"

	"content": "The Grid component  Introduction The Grid component provides tools that allow you to build, manage and display your data tables. The most important parts of Grid component are:\n Grid definition - defines structural information about a grid. Grid data - stores data for a grid. Search criteria - stores sorting, pagination and filters data for a grid.  Grid definition This is the most fundamental part of the Grid component. A Grid definition stores structural information about your Grid that defines:\n Id - unique id for Grid identification. It is used to dispatch hooks and identify Grid in other parts of the application. Name - human readable name, it is recommended to make it translatable. Columns - definition of columns that your Grid table has. Filters - definition of filters that are supported by Grid. Grid actions - actions that apply to a whole grid. It is common to have \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Show SQL query\u0026rdquo; and similar grid actions. Bulk actions - actions that can be applied to multiple records in the Grid. It is common to have \u0026ldquo;Delete selected\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Enable selected\u0026rdquo; and similar bulk actions.  Creating Grid Definition You don\u0026rsquo;t have to create the Grid Definition by yourself but instead rely on a PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\GridDefinitionFactoryInterface. PrestaShop already provides you with an abstract factory implementation PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\AbstractGridDefinitionFactory that you can use to create Grid definitions.\nWhen creating a Grid definition it is recommended to use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\AbstractGridDefinitionFactory as it allows you to define your structure, but takes care of the definition creation.

Search Criteria can be loaded from the database, URL query or anywhere else.\nThe Grid component itself does not manage Search Criteria but instead it provides an interface for it. In PrestaShop, the Filters component is used to resolve Search Criteria for a Grid. Search Criteria is immutable. This means that once a Search Criteria object is created it cannot be changed. Creating Search Criteria Even though most of the time Search Criteria will be created using the Filters component, you can still create it manually. Grid provides a simple implementation for it.\n\u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Search\\SearchCriteria; $filters = [ \u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 4, \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;mug\u0026#39;, ]; $searchCriteria = new SearchCriteria( $filters, \u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;asc\u0026#39;, 0, 10 ); $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getFilters(); // $filters array $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderBy(); // \u0026#34;id_product\u0026#34; $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderWay(); // \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34; $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOffset(); // 0 $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getLimit(); // 10  The class PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Search\\SearchCriteria is only available since 1.7.6  When creating Search Criteria you can skip some or all of its data.

Grid Data is stored in PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Data\\GridData.\nCreating Grid Data The Grid component does not create Grid Data directly but instead relies on PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Data\\Factory\\GridDataFactoryInterface. PrestaShop provides you with a DoctrineGridDataFactory implementation out of the box which supports retrieving data from a MySQL database using Doctrine. However, if you need to load data from a REST API, Elasticsearch or any other data store, you can implement your own Grid Data factory.\nWe will be using DoctrineGridDataFactory to create data for our Grid. When using DoctrineGridDataFactory you have to implement DoctrineQueryBuilderInterface which will be used by the data factory to build Doctrine queries.\nWhen implementing DoctrineQueryBuilderInterface it is recommended to use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Query\\AbstractDoctrineQueryBuilder as it provides access to the Doctrine Connection and database tables prefix. \u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Query\\AbstractDoctrineQueryBuilder; final class ProductQueryBuilder extends AbstractDoctrineQueryBuilder { /** * @var int */ private $contextLangId; /** * @var int */ private $contextShopId; /** * @param Connection $connection * @param string $dbPrefix * @param int $contextLangId * @param int $contextShopId */ public function __construct(Connection $connection, $dbPrefix, $contextLangId, $contextShopId) { parent::__construct($connection, $dbPrefix); $this-\u0026gt;contextLangId = $contextLangId; $this-\u0026gt;contextShopId = $contextShopId; } // Get Search query builder returns a QueryBuilder that is used to fetch filtered, sorted and paginated data from the database.  // This query builder is also used to get the SQL query that was executed.  public function getSearchQueryBuilder(SearchCriteriaInterface $searchCriteria) { $qb = $this-\u0026gt;getBaseQuery(); $qb-\u0026gt;select(\u0026#39;p.id_product, p.reference, pl.name\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;orderBy( $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderBy(), $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderWay() ) -\u0026gt;setFirstResult($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOffset()) -\u0026gt;setMaxResults($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getLimit()); foreach ($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getFilters() as $filterName =\u0026gt; $filterValue) { if (\u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39; === $filterName) { $qb-\u0026gt;andWhere(\u0026#34;p.id_product = :$filterName\u0026#34;); $qb-\u0026gt;setParameter($filterName, $filterValue); continue; } $qb-\u0026gt;andWhere(\u0026#34;$filterNameLIKE :$filterName\u0026#34;); $qb-\u0026gt;setParameter($filterName, \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;.$filterValue.\u0026#39;%\u0026#39;); } return $qb; } // Get Count query builder that is used to get the total count of all records (products)  public function getCountQueryBuilder(SearchCriteriaInterface $searchCriteria) { $qb = $this-\u0026gt;getBaseQuery(); $qb-\u0026gt;select(\u0026#39;COUNT(p.id_product)\u0026#39;); return $qb; } // Base query can be used for both Search and Count query builders  private function getBaseQuery() { return $this-\u0026gt;connection -\u0026gt;createQueryBuilder() -\u0026gt;from($this-\u0026gt;dbPrefix.\u0026#39;product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;leftJoin( \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;dbPrefix.\u0026#39;product_lang\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pl\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p.id_product = pl.id_product AND pl.id_lang = :context_lang_id AND pl.id_shop = :context_shop_id\u0026#39; ) -\u0026gt;setParameter(\u0026#39;context_lang_id\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;contextLangId) -\u0026gt;setParameter(\u0026#39;context_shop_id\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;contextShopId) ; } } Once the Query builder is done, the last step is to register it as a service and configure your DoctrineGridDataFactory to use it.\n# Register ProductQueryBuilderprestashop.core.grid.query.product_query_builder:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Query\\ProductQueryBuilder\u0026#39;parent:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.grid.abstract_query_builder\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#34;@=service(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.legacy.context\u0026#39;).getContext().language.id\u0026#34;- \u0026#34;@=service(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.legacy.context\u0026#39;).getContext().shop.id\u0026#34;public:true# Configure our Grid Data factory to use the query builder that we registered aboveprestashop.core.grid.data.factory.product_data_factory:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Data\\Factory\\DoctrineGridDataFactory\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.query.product_query_builder\u0026#39;# service id of our query builder- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.hook.dispatcher\u0026#39;# every doctrine query builder needs the hook dispatcher- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.query.doctrine_query_parser\u0026#39;# parser to get the raw SQL query- \u0026#39;products\u0026#39;# this should match your grid id, in our case it\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;products\u0026#34;That\u0026rsquo;s it!

	"content": "The Grid component  Introduction The Grid component provides tools that allow you to build, manage and display your data tables. The most important parts of Grid component are:\n Grid definition - defines structural information about a grid. Grid data - stores data for a grid. Search criteria - stores sorting, pagination and filters data for a grid.  Grid definition This is the most fundamental part of the Grid component. A Grid definition stores structural information about your Grid that defines:\n Id - unique id for Grid identification. It is used to dispatch hooks and identify Grid in other parts of the application. Name - human readable name, it is recommended to make it translatable. Columns - definition of columns that your Grid table has. Filters - definition of filters that are supported by Grid. Grid actions - actions that apply to a whole grid. It is common to have \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Show SQL query\u0026rdquo; and similar grid actions. Bulk actions - actions that can be applied to multiple records in the Grid. It is common to have \u0026ldquo;Delete selected\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Enable selected\u0026rdquo; and similar bulk actions.  Creating Grid Definition You don\u0026rsquo;t have to create the Grid Definition by yourself but instead rely on a PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Definition\\Factory\\GridDefinitionFactoryInterface.

When using DoctrineGridDataFactory you have to implement DoctrineQueryBuilderInterface which will be used by the data factory to build Doctrine queries.\nWhen implementing DoctrineQueryBuilderInterface it is recommended to use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Query\\AbstractDoctrineQueryBuilder as it provides access to the Doctrine Connection and database tables prefix. \u0026lt;?php use PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Query\\AbstractDoctrineQueryBuilder; final class ProductQueryBuilder extends AbstractDoctrineQueryBuilder { /** * @var int */ private $contextLangId; /** * @var int */ private $contextShopId; /** * @param Connection $connection * @param string $dbPrefix * @param int $contextLangId * @param int $contextShopId */ public function __construct(Connection $connection, $dbPrefix, $contextLangId, $contextShopId) { parent::__construct($connection, $dbPrefix); $this-\u0026gt;contextLangId = $contextLangId; $this-\u0026gt;contextShopId = $contextShopId; } // Get Search query builder returns a QueryBuilder that is used to fetch filtered, sorted and paginated data from the database.  // This query builder is also used to get the SQL query that was executed.  public function getSearchQueryBuilder(SearchCriteriaInterface $searchCriteria) { $qb = $this-\u0026gt;getBaseQuery(); $qb-\u0026gt;select(\u0026#39;p.id_product, p.reference, pl.name\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;orderBy( $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderBy(), $searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOrderWay() ) -\u0026gt;setFirstResult($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getOffset()) -\u0026gt;setMaxResults($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getLimit()); foreach ($searchCriteria-\u0026gt;getFilters() as $filterName =\u0026gt; $filterValue) { if (\u0026#39;id_product\u0026#39; === $filterName) { $qb-\u0026gt;andWhere(\u0026#34;p.id_product = :$filterName\u0026#34;); $qb-\u0026gt;setParameter($filterName, $filterValue); continue; } $qb-\u0026gt;andWhere(\u0026#34;$filterNameLIKE :$filterName\u0026#34;); $qb-\u0026gt;setParameter($filterName, \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;.$filterValue.\u0026#39;%\u0026#39;); } return $qb; } // Get Count query builder that is used to get the total count of all records (products)  public function getCountQueryBuilder(SearchCriteriaInterface $searchCriteria) { $qb = $this-\u0026gt;getBaseQuery(); $qb-\u0026gt;select(\u0026#39;COUNT(p.id_product)\u0026#39;); return $qb; } // Base query can be used for both Search and Count query builders  private function getBaseQuery() { return $this-\u0026gt;connection -\u0026gt;createQueryBuilder() -\u0026gt;from($this-\u0026gt;dbPrefix.\u0026#39;product\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt;leftJoin( \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;dbPrefix.\u0026#39;product_lang\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pl\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p.id_product = pl.id_product AND pl.id_lang = :context_lang_id AND pl.id_shop = :context_shop_id\u0026#39; ) -\u0026gt;setParameter(\u0026#39;context_lang_id\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;contextLangId) -\u0026gt;setParameter(\u0026#39;context_shop_id\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;contextShopId) ; } } Once the Query builder is done, the last step is to register it as a service and configure your DoctrineGridDataFactory to use it.\n# Register ProductQueryBuilderprestashop.core.grid.query.product_query_builder:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Query\\ProductQueryBuilder\u0026#39;parent:\u0026#39;prestashop.core.grid.abstract_query_builder\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#34;@=service(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.legacy.context\u0026#39;).getContext().language.id\u0026#34;- \u0026#34;@=service(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.legacy.context\u0026#39;).getContext().shop.id\u0026#34;public:true# Configure our Grid Data factory to use the query builder that we registered aboveprestashop.core.grid.data.factory.product_data_factory:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\Data\\Factory\\DoctrineGridDataFactory\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.query.product_query_builder\u0026#39;# service id of our query builder- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.hook.dispatcher\u0026#39;# every doctrine query builder needs the hook dispatcher- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.query.doctrine_query_parser\u0026#39;# parser to get the raw SQL query- \u0026#39;products\u0026#39;# this should match your grid id, in our case it\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;products\u0026#34;That\u0026rsquo;s it!

Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to combine those services to create our Grid!\nConfiguring Grid factory As always, you should not create Grid by hand, PrestaShop already comes with PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\GridFactory whose primary job is to create a Grid.\nIt is recommended to use the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\GridFactory to create Grids although you may need to create your own Grid factory in some rare cases. Let\u0026rsquo;s configure a GridFactory with our Grid Definition and Grid Data factory.\n# Configure Grid factory to use services we have implementedprestashop.core.grid.product_grid_factory:class:\u0026#39;PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Grid\\GridFactory\u0026#39;arguments:- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.definition.factory.product_grid_definition_factory\u0026#39;# our definition factory- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.data.factory.product_data_factory\u0026#39;# our data factory- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.grid.filter.form_factory\u0026#39;# core service needed by grid factory- \u0026#39;@prestashop.core.hook.dispatcher\u0026#39;# core service needed by grid factoryAnd we are done! Let\u0026rsquo;s see how to use it and render it in the page.\nRendering Grid In Back Office controllers, you can use the Grid Factory to create a Grid and render it.\n\u0026lt;?php use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request; use Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response; class ProductController extends FrameworkBundleAdminController { /** * @return Response */ public function indexAction() { $searchCriteria = ... $productGridFactory = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.grid.product_grid_factory\u0026#39;); $productGrid = $productGridFactory-\u0026gt;getGrid($searchCriteria); return $this-\u0026gt;render(\u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Product/products.html.twig\u0026#39;, [ // $this-\u0026gt;presentGrid() is a helper method provided by FrameworkBundleAdminController  \u0026#39;productsGrid\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;presentGrid($productGrid), ]); } } To see the Grid in your page you have to include its template, which is provided by PrestaShop.\n{# @PrestaShop/Admin/Product/products.html.twig #}{% include \u0026#39;@PrestaShop/Admin/Common/Grid/grid_panel.html.twig\u0026#39; with {\u0026#39;grid\u0026#39;: productsGrid} %}It is possible to include the provided template and modify some parts of it, or you can create your own template to render the Grid.\nWorkflows Main workflow  Main workflow of the Grid Component   You can update this schema using the source XML file importable in services like draw.io.

Modules can subscribe to hooks in order to provide or alter features.\nThere are two types of hooks:\n Display hooks – Integrated mainly (but not exclusively) in templates, they allow modules to provide content that will be injected somewhere in a page.

	"content": "The Import component The legacy import page is not fully migrated to new architecture yet. Introduction The import workflow consists of the following steps:\n Configuration in import step 1 (such as data source, separators, other settings). Entity fields matching to data source columns in import step 2. Data validation process. Import process.  When using word entity, we are referring to a business entity from PrestaShop, such as Product, Category, Address, etc. Import step 1 This page consists of import configuration, where you select the import data source and choose wanted options, such as field separators, import language, whether old data should be truncated or not, etc. All configuration which is selected in this page, is represented by the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigInterface.\n Import step 1   Import configuration The default implementation of the mentioned configuration interface (PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigInterface) in PrestaShop can be seen in PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfig class. This class is a value object, which values are not supposed to change during one import operation.\nThe default ImportConfig implementation can be instantiated using the factory PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigFactory.\nImport step 2 In the second import step we can configure only two things that are directly related to the import:\n Number of rows to skip from the top of import file. Entity fields matching to data source columns.   Import step 2   Number of rows to skip The number of rows to skip from the top of import file value is also held in the default ImportConfig implementation and is exposed by the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigInterface. The interface fits well for this configuration value, because the value is not supposed to change during the import operation.\nEntity fields matching  Entity fields matching can be explained as selecting which of the available entity fields is represented by which column in the import file. There are a couple of classes implemented in PrestaShop, that ease up the entity fields matching:\n Import entity - represented by PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Entity. Entity field - represented by PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityField. Data row - represented by PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\DataRow.  Import entity This class holds all import types, that are available by default in PrestaShop and allows to retrieve them easily:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/Entity.php  final class Entity { const TYPE_CATEGORIES = 0; const TYPE_PRODUCTS = 1; const TYPE_COMBINATIONS = 2; const TYPE_CUSTOMERS = 3; const TYPE_ADDRESSES = 4; const TYPE_MANUFACTURERS = 5; const TYPE_SUPPLIERS = 6; const TYPE_ALIAS = 7; const TYPE_STORE_CONTACTS = 8; \u0026lt;...\u0026gt; } Entity field Entity field is described by an implementation of PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityFieldInterface.\nEntity fields are stored in collections, by implementing PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityFieldCollectionInterface. Entity field collection default implementation is this class: PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityFieldCollection.\nEntity field collections are provided by providers, which implement PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\Provider\\EntityFieldsProviderInterface. Every entity, which is available for import in PrestaShop, has it\u0026rsquo;s own fields provider in the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\Provider namespace.\nFor example, the entity fields provider for Customer entity builds the entity fields collection in the following way:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/EntityField/Provider/CustomerFieldsProvider.php  final class CustomerFieldsProvider implements EntityFieldsProviderInterface { public function getCollection() { $fields = [ new EntityField(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;ID\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;active\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Active (0/1)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;id_gender\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Titles ID (Mr = 1, Ms = 2, else 0)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Email\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;passwd\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Password\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;birthday\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Birth date (yyyy-mm-dd)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;lastname\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Last name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;firstname\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;First name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;newsletter\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Newsletter (0/1)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;optin\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Partner offers (0/1)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;date_add\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Registration date (yyyy-mm-dd)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;group\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Groups (x,y,z...)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;id_default_group\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Default group ID\u0026#39;)), new EntityField( \u0026#39;id_shop\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;ID / Name of shop\u0026#39;), $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Ignore this field if you don\\\u0026#39;t use the Multistore tool. If you leave this field empty, the default shop will be used.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Advparameters.Help\u0026#39;) ), ]; return EntityFieldCollection::createFromArray($fields); } // ... } Data row DataRow is an object representation of a data row from import source file.\nDataRow is described by an interface PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\DataRowInterface and can be used in collections to represent multiple rows of data.\nDataRow collections can be built using DataRowCollectionFactory, which should implement the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\Factory\\DataRowCollectionFactoryInterface.\nCurrently there is one DataRowCollectionFactory implementation available in PrestaShop, which builds the DataRowCollection by reading a data file:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/File/DataRow/Factory/DataRowCollectionFactory.php  final class DataRowCollectionFactory implements DataRowCollectionFactoryInterface { // ...  public function buildFromFile(SplFileInfo $file, $maxRowsInCollection = null) { $dataRowCollection = new DataRowCollection(); $rowIndex = 0; foreach ($this-\u0026gt;fileReader-\u0026gt;read($file) as $dataRow) { if (null !== $maxRowsInCollection \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $rowIndex \u0026gt;= $maxRowsInCollection) { break; } $dataRowCollection-\u0026gt;addDataRow($dataRow); ++$rowIndex; } return $dataRowCollection; } } Import operation The import operation can be imaged as multiple smaller import processes running one after another, until the data is fully imported or critical errors occur.\nImport operation can be described by three essential parts:\n Import configuration preparation. The import handler. The importer.  Import configuration preparation To run the import process we have to prepare the configuration for it. As mentioned in previous topics, there are two configuration objects (ImportConfig and ImportRuntimeConfig), that have to be prepared for the import process. Both of them can be built using factories, which are described by interfaces PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigFactoryInterface and PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportRuntimeConfigFactoryInterface.\nThere is one implementation of each of the two configuration interfaces in PrestaShop. Both of them are available to build the relevant import config object out of Symfony Request:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/Configuration/ImportConfigFactory.php  final class ImportConfigFactory implements ImportConfigFactoryInterface { public function buildFromRequest(Request $request) { $separator = $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;get( \u0026#39;separator\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;separator\u0026#39;, ImportSettings::DEFAULT_SEPARATOR) ); $multivalueSeparator = $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;get( \u0026#39;multiple_value_separator\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;multiple_value_separator\u0026#39;, ImportSettings::DEFAULT_MULTIVALUE_SEPARATOR) ); return new ImportConfig( $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;csv\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;csv\u0026#39;)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getInt(\u0026#39;entity\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;entity\u0026#39;, 0)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;iso_lang\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;iso_lang\u0026#39;)), $separator, $multivalueSeparator, $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getBoolean(\u0026#39;truncate\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;truncate\u0026#39;, false)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getBoolean(\u0026#39;regenerate\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;regenerate\u0026#39;, false)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getBoolean(\u0026#39;match_ref\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;match_ref\u0026#39;, false)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getBoolean(\u0026#39;forceIDs\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;forceIDs\u0026#39;, false)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getBoolean(\u0026#39;sendemail\u0026#39;, $request-\u0026gt;getSession()-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;sendemail\u0026#39;, true)), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getInt(\u0026#39;skip\u0026#39;, 0) ); } } \u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/Configuration/ImportRuntimeConfigFactory.php  final class ImportRuntimeConfigFactory implements ImportRuntimeConfigFactoryInterface { public function buildFromRequest(Request $request) { $sharedData = $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;crossStepsVars\u0026#39;, []); return new ImportRuntimeConfig( $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getBoolean(\u0026#39;validateOnly\u0026#39;), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getInt(\u0026#39;offset\u0026#39;), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;getInt(\u0026#39;limit\u0026#39;), json_decode($sharedData, true), $request-\u0026gt;request-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;type_value\u0026#39;, []) ); } } Import handler To handle the import process we must prepare an ImportHandler, which will have access to our specific logic for import operation. The ImportHandler should implement PrestaShop/PrestaShop/Core/Import/Handler/ImportHandlerInterface.\nThere are three main methods exposed by the interface, which are essential for import logic execution:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/Handler/ImportHandlerInterface.php  interface ImportHandlerInterface { /** * Executed before import process is started. */ public function setUp(ImportConfigInterface $importConfig, ImportRuntimeConfigInterface $runtimeConfig); /** * Imports one data row. */ public function importRow( ImportConfigInterface $importConfig, ImportRuntimeConfigInterface $runtimeConfig, DataRowInterface $dataRow ); /** * Executed when the import process is completed. */ public function tearDown(ImportConfigInterface $importConfig, ImportRuntimeConfigInterface $runtimeConfig); // ... }  setUp() - executed before each import process. You can set prerequisites in this method, log some data, or execute additional operations that should be executed before starting the import. The method has both ImportConfigInterface and ImportRuntimeConfigInterface as arguments, meaning you can access the configuration if needed for import preparation. importRow() - executed for every row that\u0026rsquo;s being imported. This method should run the logic, that imports the data for one row. In addition to import configuration, this method also has a PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\DataRowInterface as an argument, which is an object representation of the current row from the import data source. tearDown() - executed when the import process is finished. Useful for actions that have to be done only once after each process.  Importer The Importer is responsible for running the import logic from ImportHandler, and applying the import configuration properly during the process. Importer is an object that implements the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\ImporterInterface. PrestaShop comes with one Importer implementation (PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Importer), which can be easily used for your needs.\nThe PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\ImporterInterface exposes only one method:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/ImporterInterface.php  interface ImporterInterface { /** * Process the import. */ public function import( ImportConfigInterface $importConfig, ImportRuntimeConfigInterface $runtimeConfig, ImportHandlerInterface $importHandler ); } import() method accepts the import configurations and the import handler implementation as arguments and will execute the import logic automatically.\nImport execution example in a controller The processImportAction() controller action (from the example below) imports one batch of the import data at a time. It can be run multiple times, until all data is fully imported.\nThe controller action below is being called multiple times (via AJAX) by the JavaScript part of the import component, until all data is imported from the source file:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin/Configure/AdvancedParameters/ImportController.php  public function processImportAction(Request $request) { $importer = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.import.importer\u0026#39;); $importConfigFactory = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.import.config_factory\u0026#39;); $runtimeConfigFactory = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.core.import.runtime_config_factory\u0026#39;); $importHandlerFinder = $this-\u0026gt;get(\u0026#39;prestashop.adapter.import.handler_finder\u0026#39;); // Building the configuration objects  $importConfig = $importConfigFactory-\u0026gt;buildFromRequest($request); $runtimeConfig = $runtimeConfigFactory-\u0026gt;buildFromRequest($request); // Running the import process  $importer-\u0026gt;import( $importConfig, $runtimeConfig, $importHandlerFinder-\u0026gt;find($importConfig-\u0026gt;getEntityType()) // Finding import handler  ); return $this-\u0026gt;json($runtimeConfig-\u0026gt;toArray()); } Related JavaScript Since the import operation can be heavy and take many resources to complete (depending on the amount of data to be imported), in PrestaShop it is being executed in smaller processes. To achieve that, some JavaScript code is being used, which continuously fires AJAX requests that trigger the import processing on the server, until the import finishes.\nAll JavaScript code, which is used by the import component, can be found under admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/pages/import-data/ directory. We can find different JavaScript components there, which are explained below.\nEntityFieldsValidator Responsible for validating selected entity fields in import page 2 data table. It makes sure that you don\u0026rsquo;t miss any required fields, prevents you from selecting same field twice and shows error messages if you do.\n Validation in import step 2 - duplicate fields   ImportBatchSizeCalculator Calculates the most reasonable batch size for each import process, depending on server\u0026rsquo;s response time. It adapts the batch size of the next import iteration by measuring how long it took for the server to process the data in previous import iteration.\nImportDataTable Responsible for pagination functionality in the import data preview table. The pagination arrows appear below the data table and can be used to peek the source file preview forward or backwards.\n Import step 2 data preview table - pagination arrows   ImportMatchConfiguration Responsible for saving, loading or deleting import matches configurations. Import match configuration allows saving the matched entity fields for later reusability.\n Import match configuration interface   PostSizeChecker Responsible for checking if POST size limit is being reached. It\u0026rsquo;s used in each import process, to make sure it won\u0026rsquo;t reach the limits.\nImportProgressModal Responsible for displaying the import progress for the end user in a modal window. It updates the progress bar of the modal, displays messages, shows/hides the buttons in modal when asked for.\n Import modal   Importer Executes import process and fires AJAX import requests continuously. It uses the PostSizeChecker, ImportBatchCalculator and ImportProgressModal components internally and connects them to execute the import process.\nImportDataPage Responsible for running the Importer component when the end user clicks Import button. Collects data from the import match configuration form and passes it to the Importer.\n"

	"content": "The Import component The legacy import page is not fully migrated to new architecture yet. Introduction The import workflow consists of the following steps:\n Configuration in import step 1 (such as data source, separators, other settings). Entity fields matching to data source columns in import step 2. Data validation process. Import process.  When using word entity, we are referring to a business entity from PrestaShop, such as Product, Category, Address, etc. Import step 1 This page consists of import configuration, where you select the import data source and choose wanted options, such as field separators, import language, whether old data should be truncated or not, etc. All configuration which is selected in this page, is represented by the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigInterface.\n Import step 1   Import configuration The default implementation of the mentioned configuration interface (PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigInterface) in PrestaShop can be seen in PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfig class. This class is a value object, which values are not supposed to change during one import operation.\nThe default ImportConfig implementation can be instantiated using the factory PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigFactory.\nImport step 2 In the second import step we can configure only two things that are directly related to the import:\n Number of rows to skip from the top of import file. Entity fields matching to data source columns.   Import step 2   Number of rows to skip The number of rows to skip from the top of import file value is also held in the default ImportConfig implementation and is exposed by the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Configuration\\ImportConfigInterface. The interface fits well for this configuration value, because the value is not supposed to change during the import operation.\nEntity fields matching  Entity fields matching can be explained as selecting which of the available entity fields is represented by which column in the import file. There are a couple of classes implemented in PrestaShop, that ease up the entity fields matching:\n Import entity - represented by PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\Entity. Entity field - represented by PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityField. Data row - represented by PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\DataRow.  Import entity This class holds all import types, that are available by default in PrestaShop and allows to retrieve them easily:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/Entity.php  final class Entity { const TYPE_CATEGORIES = 0; const TYPE_PRODUCTS = 1; const TYPE_COMBINATIONS = 2; const TYPE_CUSTOMERS = 3; const TYPE_ADDRESSES = 4; const TYPE_MANUFACTURERS = 5; const TYPE_SUPPLIERS = 6; const TYPE_ALIAS = 7; const TYPE_STORE_CONTACTS = 8; \u0026lt;...\u0026gt; } Entity field Entity field is described by an implementation of PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityFieldInterface.\nEntity fields are stored in collections, by implementing PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityFieldCollectionInterface. Entity field collection default implementation is this class: PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\EntityFieldCollection.\nEntity field collections are provided by providers, which implement PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\Provider\\EntityFieldsProviderInterface. Every entity, which is available for import in PrestaShop, has it\u0026rsquo;s own fields provider in the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\EntityField\\Provider namespace.\nFor example, the entity fields provider for Customer entity builds the entity fields collection in the following way:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/EntityField/Provider/CustomerFieldsProvider.php  final class CustomerFieldsProvider implements EntityFieldsProviderInterface { public function getCollection() { $fields = [ new EntityField(\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;ID\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;active\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Active (0/1)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;id_gender\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Titles ID (Mr = 1, Ms = 2, else 0)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Email\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;passwd\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Password\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;birthday\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Birth date (yyyy-mm-dd)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;lastname\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Last name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;firstname\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;First name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Global\u0026#39;), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, true), new EntityField(\u0026#39;newsletter\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Newsletter (0/1)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;optin\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Partner offers (0/1)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;date_add\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Registration date (yyyy-mm-dd)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;group\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Groups (x,y,z...)\u0026#39;)), new EntityField(\u0026#39;id_default_group\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Default group ID\u0026#39;)), new EntityField( \u0026#39;id_shop\u0026#39;, $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;ID / Name of shop\u0026#39;), $this-\u0026gt;trans(\u0026#39;Ignore this field if you don\\\u0026#39;t use the Multistore tool. If you leave this field empty, the default shop will be used.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin.Advparameters.Help\u0026#39;) ), ]; return EntityFieldCollection::createFromArray($fields); } // ... } Data row DataRow is an object representation of a data row from import source file.\nDataRow is described by an interface PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\DataRowInterface and can be used in collections to represent multiple rows of data.\nDataRow collections can be built using DataRowCollectionFactory, which should implement the PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\Import\\File\\DataRow\\Factory\\DataRowCollectionFactoryInterface.\nCurrently there is one DataRowCollectionFactory implementation available in PrestaShop, which builds the DataRowCollection by reading a data file:\n\u0026lt;?php // src/Core/Import/File/DataRow/Factory/DataRowCollectionFactory.php  final class DataRowCollectionFactory implements DataRowCollectionFactoryInterface { // ...  public function buildFromFile(SplFileInfo $file, $maxRowsInCollection = null) { $dataRowCollection = new DataRowCollection(); $rowIndex = 0; foreach ($this-\u0026gt;fileReader-\u0026gt;read($file) as $dataRow) { if (null !== $maxRowsInCollection \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $rowIndex \u0026gt;= $maxRowsInCollection) { break; } $dataRowCollection-\u0026gt;addDataRow($dataRow); ++$rowIndex; } return $dataRowCollection; } } Import operation The import operation can be imaged as multiple smaller import processes running one after another, until the data is fully imported or critical errors occur.\nImport operation can be described by three essential parts:\n Import configuration preparation. The import handler. The importer.  Import configuration preparation To run the import process we have to prepare the configuration for it. As mentioned in previous topics, there are two configuration objects (ImportConfig and ImportRuntimeConfig), that have to be prepared for the import process.

It adapts the batch size of the next import iteration by measuring how long it took for the server to process the data in previous import iteration.\nImportDataTable Responsible for pagination functionality in the import data preview table. The pagination arrows appear below the data table and can be used to peek the source file preview forward or backwards.\n Import step 2 data preview table - pagination arrows   ImportMatchConfiguration Responsible for saving, loading or deleting import matches configurations. Import match configuration allows saving the matched entity fields for later reusability.\n Import match configuration interface   PostSizeChecker Responsible for checking if POST size limit is being reached. It\u0026rsquo;s used in each import process, to make sure it won\u0026rsquo;t reach the limits.\nImportProgressModal Responsible for displaying the import progress for the end user in a modal window. It updates the progress bar of the modal, displays messages, shows/hides the buttons in modal when asked for.\n Import modal   Importer Executes import process and fires AJAX import requests continuously. It uses the PostSizeChecker, ImportBatchCalculator and ImportProgressModal components internally and connects them to execute the import process.\nImportDataPage Responsible for running the Importer component when the end user clicks Import button. Collects data from the import match configuration form and passes it to the Importer.\n"

	"content": "The Mail Template component  Introduction PrestaShop\u0026rsquo;s email notification system is based on static template files, one for each kind of message (like account creation, order confirmation, etc), which are stored in the mails folder. In order to localize these messages, PrestaShop needs a copy of each template, translated to every supported language. Shops download these translated versions when installing a new language pack.\nThis system has a few drawbacks. Shops need to download email packs every time a new language is installed, and if a template had not been translated to that language, you ended up with emails in English. This gets even more complicated when you use an email theme (from Addons or a freelance designer) which is therefore limited to the languages the authors translated by themselves. Also, any customization performed in a template has to be replicated for every installed language.\nStarting on 1.7.6, this feature has been significantly revamped. To avoid introducing breaking changes, the system still relies on static email templates, which are used by the Mail::send method. However, instead of downloading translated copies of each template, these files are now dynamically generated whenever you install a new language, using base templates, or layouts.\nThis is the first step to improving the email system in PrestaShop. As the feature gets further improved we will add more advanced customization for email templates.\nVocabulary Terms like \u0026ldquo;layouts\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;templates\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;themes\u0026rdquo; can be confusing, so let\u0026rsquo;s clarify them:\n  Mail themes are groups of Layouts with a given style, stored in the mails/themes/ directory.\nYou can have many mail themes installed, but only one active at a time.\n  Layouts are files that will be rendered using Twig to generate ready-to-use mail Templates.\nThey can use logic statements, translate wordings, extend other base layouts or include components. They are the basic files that make up your Mail theme.\n  Templates are static, translated files (html or txt) that will be generated by MailThemeGenerator from Layouts of a given Mail theme in a given language.\nThey contain no logic and are translated for ONE language. These are the files used by the Mail class when you send a mail and are located in the mails/ directory, grouped by language (mails/en/, mails/fr/, \u0026hellip;).\n  Architecture Folder structure The new email themes layout files are stored in the mails/themes/ folder. PrestaShop 1.7.6 is bundled with two email themes:\n classic – The default email theme that was bundled with PrestaShop up until the 1.7.5 version. modern – A new email theme with a modern, responsive design.  Each of these folder contains twig layouts which are organized in a conventional way:\n... ├── mails | ├── themes | | ├── modern | | | ├── assets # Contains the assets used in your layouts (optional) | | | ├── components # Contains block parts or base layouts for your email theme (optional) | | | | ├── footer.html.twig | | | | ├── layout.html.twig | | | ├── core # Contains layouts for Core transactional mails | | | | ├── account.html.twig # HTML layout for \u0026#34;account\u0026#34; transactional mail | | | | ├── account.txt.twig # TXT layout for \u0026#34;account\u0026#34; transactional mail | | | | ├── bankwire.html.twig # HTML layout for \u0026#34;bankwire\u0026#34; transactional mail | | | | ├── cheque.txt.twig # TXT layout for \u0026#34;cheque\u0026#34; transactional mail | | | | ├── contact.html.twig # HTML layout for \u0026#34;contact\u0026#34; transactional mail | | | ├── modules # Contains layouts specific to a given module | | | | ├── followup # Module name | | | | | ├── followup_1.html.twig | | | | | ├── followup_2.html.twig | | | | ├── ps_emailalerts # Module name | | | | | ├── new_order.html.twig | | | | | ├── followup_2.html.twig ... As you can see there are two types of layouts, one for each type of template:\n HTML layouts, which generate HTML templates and can contain tags for attractive design, images, links, etc. TXT layouts, which only contain plain text, used for old email clients or non interactive environments.  The layout name should respect the following convention: {layout_name}.{layout_type}.twig\nFor example:\n account.html.twig : layout for the account mail template in its html version cheque.txt.twig : layout for the cheque mail template in its txt version  As you may have noticed, some of our layouts have both types (e.g.: account) whereas others only have html or txt type (bankwire, cheque, \u0026hellip;). This is because you are not forced to define both types as they will be used as a fallback for each other:\n If only the html type is available, the same layout will be stripped of html tags and the resulting plain text will be used as your txt layout. If only the txt type is available, the same layout will be used for html layout (but it won\u0026rsquo;t have images nor any other rich elements).  Thanks to this fallback system, and since we mostly want rich HTML emails, most email themes will only contain html layouts, and txt layouts will be automatically generated from them. Themes and Layouts PrestaShop uses objects to manipulate email themes and layouts, they implement the following interfaces:\n PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\ThemeInterface – Describes a theme and provides a list of its layouts PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\Layout\\LayoutInterface – Describes a theme layout (name, file paths, related module\u0026hellip;)  These interfaces have a corresponding collection that is used in the core services and provided via hooks:\n PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\ThemeCollectionInterface PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\Layout\\LayoutCollectionInterface  Of course, PrestaShop provides concrete implementations which you are encouraged to reuse:\n PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\Theme PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\ThemeCollection PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\Layout\\Layout PrestaShop\\PrestaShop\\Core\\MailTemplate\\Layout\\LayoutCollection  Generation workflow The templates from layouts generation workflow is a bit complex, here are the main components:\n GenerateThemeMailTemplatesCommand describes the generation settings (eg. which theme are we generating and in which language). GenerateThemeMailTemplatesCommandHandler is the command bus handler in charge of executing the generation using the configured MailTemplateGenerator. FolderThemeCatalog provides a ThemeCollection, which is built by scanning mail themes in folders. MailTemplateGenerator drives the generation of a ThemeInterface for the requested LanguageInterface. MailTemplateTwigRenderer actually renders the layout using the Twig renderer, and post-processes the result by applying any existing TransformationInterface. LayoutVariablesBuilder provides variables to be used in the Twig layouts.   Email Generation Workflow (it is advised to open it in another tab as the image is quite big)   You can update this schema using the source XML file importable in services like draw.io. Available hooks As you can see in the workflow, the email generation process includes a few hooks that allow you to include your own themes, layouts, variables and transformations:\n actionListMailThemes allows you to modify the ThemeCollection (add, remove, modify a theme or/and its layouts) actionBuildMailLayoutVariables allows you to modify the variables of a specific layout actionGetMailLayoutTransformations allows you to modify the transformations applied to a specific layout  Template variables Layout variables are NOT template variables\nAlways keep in mind that the variables provided by the LayoutVariablesBuilder will only be available during template generation, meaning that their value will be fixed into the exported static templates, and won\u0026rsquo;t change dynamically when your emails are being sent. They should not be confused with template variables (like firstname, lastname, \u0026hellip;) which are replaced at the last moment when the email is sent by the Mail::send function.\n Here is a quick resume of the differences:\n    Layout Template     Renderer Twig Swift_Plugins_DecoratorPlugin   Syntax {{ variable }} { variable }   Interpreted On generation When the email is being sent   Target All users/customers Specific user/action   Use cases Design, translations, \u0026hellip; Customization (user, order, \u0026hellip;)    On the same principle, you can add Twig logic in your templates, like conditions on email types, or even your own layout variables to deal with customization — but it will only be useful during email generation. So don\u0026rsquo;t use any Twig logic to adapt the templates for a specific user or order. Translation One of the main advantages of email generation is the possibility to use translations in the layouts, here is an example:\n\u0026lt;table width=\u0026#34;100%\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td align=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;titleblock\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;font size=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34; face=\u0026#34;Open-sans, sans-serif\u0026#34; color=\u0026#34;#555454\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ \u0026#39;This is a translated string\u0026#39;|trans({}, \u0026#39;EmailsBody\u0026#39;, locale)|raw }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/font\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; Templates generation Automatic generation So now that you know how the generation process works, you might wonder when exactly does it happen? There are a few cases when generation is automatic:\n In Language class and more particularly during the calls to Language::downloadAndInstallLanguagePack, Language::installLanguagePack and of course Language::installEmailsLanguagePack which is now deprecated In PrestaShopBundle\\Install\\Upgrade::run when languages are updated  Manual generation Of course sometimes you still want to manually generate your emails (new theme installed, changes in some layouts, \u0026hellip;), then you can use:\n In the Symfony command prestashop:mail:generate if you want to launch a CLI generation In the \u0026ldquo;Design \u0026gt; Email Theme\u0026rdquo; page when you use the form to launch the generation manually (once per language)  Choosing the default theme Your shop can only use one theme at a time, so if you go to the \u0026ldquo;Design \u0026gt; Email Theme\u0026rdquo; page you will be able to choose your default email theme. This default theme will be used each time the generation process is launched automatically (language installation, upgrade, \u0026hellip;).\nThe default theme starting from 1.7.6 will be the modern theme, the classic theme was provided for backward compatibility and as an example.\nTroubleshooting I changed my default theme but my emails didn\u0026rsquo;t change. Indeed when you select your default theme you simply update your configuration, so any future generation will use the theme you selected.\nHowever no generation process is launched when you select a theme, so if you want to generate your emails with your newly selected theme you need to do it manually in the \u0026ldquo;Generate emails\u0026rdquo; form.\nThe form only generates one language, so you will have to repeat the action for each Language installed on your shop. I tried to generate emails with a new theme, but my templates are still in the previous one. There are two possibilities for this issue:\n1. Overwrite already-generated templates\nAs you may have noticed, the GenerateThemeMailTemplatesCommand and the \u0026ldquo;Generate emails\u0026rdquo; form have an overwrite option. We need this option because some shops may have installed email themes, or customized their templates manually. For that reason by default the generation process does not export a template if it already exists. If you want to replace the former templates you need to enable the overwrite option.\nBe careful, using this option will replace all the existing templates! 2. Overwrite the shop theme\u0026rsquo;s mail templates\nAs you may know, your PrestaShop theme (the shop\u0026rsquo;s theme, not the email theme) can include mail templates which override the shop\u0026rsquo;s default ones. Those templates are not contained in the default mails folder, but the in themes/{my_theme}/mails/ folder. Even if you generate your new mail theme (be it automatically or manually), the shop theme\u0026rsquo;s templates will have higher priority and will be used instead of your mail theme\u0026rsquo;s.\nIn that case, generate your mail theme manually and to select the shop theme you want to overwrite. Templates will be generated in its folder and will be used from now (don\u0026rsquo;t forget to enable the overwrite option if you want to replace them).\nBe aware this operation will permanently modify your shop theme\u0026rsquo;s files!

	"content": "The Position updater component  Introduction Order elements position is a common use case in any CMS or a shop back-office. You may need to order, categories, products, modules or adds. The use cases are endless. Which is why we developed a generic component to help you manage your position updates quickly and efficiently. Combined with our Grid component this will help you build entity lists more easily.

Each form has dedicated CQRS commands to manage its content.\nFor previous versions you can read this documentation about product form before 1.7.8. Creation / Update commands Except for the initial save, all product modifications are updates, which is why AddProductCommand is a special case. It requires only:\n the product type localized names (only the name in default language is required)  Once the product is created and its ID has been generated most of the other CQRS commands are updates so they will need a ProductId identifier. They allow partial updates to minimize the amount of sent data, of course even partial update require a minimum of consistency and will have validation rules such as required fields in some cases.\nProduct form This form combines different sub form types, each one is handled by dedicated CQRS commands.\n   Form type Field Description CQRS Command     BasicInformationType basic Contains

Each form has dedicated CQRS commands to manage its content.\nFor previous versions you can read this documentation about product form before 1.7.8. Creation / Update commands Except for the initial save, all product modifications are updates, which is why AddProductCommand is a special case. It requires only:\n the product type localized names (only the name in default language is required)  Once the product is created and its ID has been generated most of the other CQRS commands are updates so they will need a ProductId identifier. They allow partial updates to minimize the amount of sent data, of course even partial update require a minimum of consistency and will have validation rules such as required fields in some cases.\nProduct form This form combines different sub form types, each one is handled by dedicated CQRS commands.\n   Form type Field Description CQRS Command     BasicInformationType basic Contains

	"content": "How to translate your theme PrestaShop 1.7 comes with a new translation system for themes.\nThe following instructions only apply to PrestaShop 1.7.2 and later. In previous versions, exported themes didn\u0026rsquo;t include the selected and included translations. 1. Add new or customize existing wordings in a theme Adding new wordings is easy when building your theme. You simply need to edit the .tpl file of your choice and add (or customize) a wording. All wordings must always be written in english.\nFor example:\n{l s=\u0026#39;Read more\u0026#39; d=\u0026#39;Shop.Yourthemename\u0026#39;}Change \u0026ldquo;Yourthemename\u0026rdquo; to your own theme\u0026rsquo;s name.\nThe theme name must start in a capital letter and have no other upper case letter (eg. \u0026ldquo;YourThemeName\u0026rdquo; won\u0026rsquo;t work). 2. Add the desired languages in your shop It is best to perform the following steps only after your shop is ready to be exported (ie. you\u0026rsquo;re done developing it).\n  On your shop, go to International \u0026gt; Translations\n  Then go to the \u0026ldquo;Add / Update a language\u0026rdquo; section and choose the languages that you wish to support in your theme.\n  3. Translate your theme\u0026rsquo;s custom translations Again, on the same \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page as in the previous step, go to the \u0026ldquo;Modify translations section\u0026rdquo; and choose:\n Theme translations The theme you wish to translate (in this example, we are translating \u0026ldquo;lifestyle\u0026rdquo;) Language to translate to (eg. \u0026ldquo;French\u0026rdquo;)  When you click on \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo;, a new page opens up that allows you to translate your theme\u0026rsquo;s wordings. On the left column, go to \u0026ldquo;Shop\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;your theme name\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Lifestyle\u0026rdquo; in this example).\nA form appears on the right, showing all the customized wordings that you added in the .tpl files.\nAt this point, all you need to do is translate them, then redo the process for each one of the languages you want to translate your theme in.\n4. Export languages Once all translations are done, you now need to export all of the wordings that you want to include in your theme. For this, go back to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page, then scroll to the \u0026ldquo;Export a language\u0026rdquo; section:\nOnce the .zip file has been downloaded, extract it and add this folder to your theme\u0026rsquo;s translations folder. This way, when you will export your theme, translations will be included with it.\n5. Export your theme After all the previous steps have been performed, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is export your theme.\n  On your shop, go to Design \u0026gt; Theme \u0026amp; logo.\n  In this page, on the top right corner, click on the \u0026ldquo;Export current theme\u0026rdquo; button.\n  After this step, the theme will be zipped an ready, and will include the translations that we added before. To verify it, just unzip the zip file and check that all the files are present.\n"

Add the desired languages in your shop It is best to perform the following steps only after your shop is ready to be exported (ie. you\u0026rsquo;re done developing it).\n  On your shop, go to International \u0026gt; Translations\n  Then go to the \u0026ldquo;Add / Update a language\u0026rdquo; section and choose the languages that you wish to support in your theme.\n  3. Translate your theme\u0026rsquo;s custom translations Again, on the same \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page as in the previous step, go to the \u0026ldquo;Modify translations section\u0026rdquo; and choose:\n Theme translations The theme you wish to translate (in this example, we are translating \u0026ldquo;lifestyle\u0026rdquo;) Language to translate to (eg. \u0026ldquo;French\u0026rdquo;)  When you click on \u0026ldquo;Modify\u0026rdquo;, a new page opens up that allows you to translate your theme\u0026rsquo;s wordings. On the left column, go to \u0026ldquo;Shop\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;your theme name\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Lifestyle\u0026rdquo; in this example).\nA form appears on the right, showing all the customized wordings that you added in the .tpl files.\nAt this point, all you need to do is translate them, then redo the process for each one of the languages you want to translate your theme in.\n4. Export languages Once all translations are done, you now need to export all of the wordings that you want to include in your theme. For this, go back to the \u0026ldquo;Translations\u0026rdquo; page, then scroll to the \u0026ldquo;Export a language\u0026rdquo; section:\nOnce the .zip file has been downloaded, extract it and add this folder to your theme\u0026rsquo;s translations folder. This way, when you will export your theme, translations will be included with it.\n5. Export your theme After all the previous steps have been performed, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is export your theme.\n  On your shop, go to Design \u0026gt; Theme \u0026amp; logo.\n  In this page, on the top right corner, click on the \u0026ldquo;Export current theme\u0026rdquo; button.\n  After this step, the theme will be zipped an ready, and will include the translations that we added before. To verify it, just unzip the zip file and check that all the files are present.\n"

	"content": "About Webpack  Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.\n The main interest of using Webpack is that it will compile all your styles - which we advise you to write using Sass  - into a single CSS file. This way, your theme will make only one HTTP request for this single file, and since your browser will cache it for later re-use, it will even download this file only once.\nThe same goes with your JavaScript code. Instead of loading jQuery along with its community plugins, your own custom plugins and any extra code you might need, Webpack compiles and minifies all this JavaScript code into a single file, which will be loaded once - and cached.\nWebpack is not at all required by PrestaShop, you are free to use your favorite tool! The documentation explains Webpack since it\u0026rsquo;s the tool we chose for the Classic theme. Installing webpack If you want to compile your assets using Webpack (and we advise you to), follow these steps:\n Download and install Node.js, which contains the npm tool. In your command line tool, open the _dev folder. Install npm: npm install. You then have a choice:   To build your assets once, type npm run build. To rebuild your assets every time you change a file in the _dev folder, type npm run watch.  Webpack configuration The Webpack configuration file for Classic Theme is thus:\n All CSS rules go to the assets/css/theme.css file. All JavaScript code go to the assets/js/theme.js file.  It provides proper configuration for compile your Sass, Less, Stylus or CSS files into a single CSS file.\nJavaScript code is written in ES6, and compiled to ES5 with Babel.\nIf you want to use Stylus or Less, simply edit the command line under the \u0026ldquo;scripts\u0026rdquo; section.\nvar webpack = require(\u0026#39;webpack\u0026#39;); var ExtractTextPlugin = require(\u0026#34;extract-text-webpack-plugin\u0026#34;); var plugins = []; plugins.push( new ExtractTextPlugin(\u0026#39;../css/theme.css\u0026#39;) ); module.exports = [{ // JavaScript  entry: [ \u0026#39;./js/theme.js\u0026#39; ], output: { path: \u0026#39;../assets/js\u0026#39;, filename: \u0026#39;theme.js\u0026#39; }, module: { loaders: [{ test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loaders: [\u0026#39;babel-loader\u0026#39;] }] }, externals: { prestashop: \u0026#39;prestashop\u0026#39; }, plugins: plugins, resolve: { extensions: [\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.js\u0026#39;] } }, { // CSS  entry: [ \u0026#39;./css/normalize.css\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;./css/example.less\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;./css/st/dev.styl\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;./css/theme.scss\u0026#39; ], output: { path: \u0026#39;../assets/js\u0026#39;, filename: \u0026#39;theme.js\u0026#39; }, module: { loaders: [{ test: /\\.scss$/, loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract( \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;css-loader?sourceMap!postcss!sass-loader?sourceMap\u0026#34; ) }, { test: /\\.styl$/, loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract( \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;css-loader?sourceMap!postcss!stylus-loader?sourceMap\u0026#34; ) }, { test: /\\.less$/, loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract( \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;css-loader?sourceMap!postcss!less-loader?sourceMap\u0026#34; ) }, { test: /\\.css$/, loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract( \u0026#39;style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;css-loader?sourceMap!postcss-loader\u0026#39; ) }, { test: /.(png|woff(2)?|eot|ttf|svg)(\\?[a-z0-9=\\.]+)?$/, loader: \u0026#39;file-loader?name=../css/[hash].[ext]\u0026#39; }] }, plugins: plugins, resolve: { extensions: [\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.scss\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.styl\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.less\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.css\u0026#39;] } }]; "
